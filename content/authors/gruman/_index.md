I have been an engineer and team manager in various roles in industry for more than 20 years. My undergraduate degree was originally in Mechanical Engineering, and I do still enjoy working with the agricultural product design and validation communities. My studies subsequently have been in business.

I am currently responsible for Digital Operations Projects at CNH Industrial in the Chicago area.
