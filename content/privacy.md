We appreciate your interest and your visit to this website. The protection of your privacy in the processing of your personal data is an important concern to which we pay special attention. We process personal data collected during your visits in accordance with the legal provisions valid for the countries in which the websites are maintained.

This Privacy Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide.

Generally, we will only use your information within the the context of this forum. We will not pass your information to others for marketing purposes unless you have consented to this.

We will require all third party data processors to whom your information is disclosed to comply strictly with our instructions and require that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes.

Where we share your information with third parties, we will ensure they treat your information with the same protection we do. If personal information is transferred to a non-agent third party, you will be given an opportunity to choose not to have your personal information shared with that third party.
