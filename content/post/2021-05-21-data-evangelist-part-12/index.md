Data science leaders from Warner Music Group, T-Mobile, Saturn Cloud, The Looma Project, and Caliber Home Loans talk in [this recent expert panel](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/building-effective-data-science-teams/) about what it takes to build successful data science teams and deliver value.

- How their teams prioritize and deliver work in a way that adds value to their organizations, while also maintaining credibility even when the results aren’t necessarily good news.
- Their advice for advancing your own data science career and collaborating with non-data-science stakeholders.
