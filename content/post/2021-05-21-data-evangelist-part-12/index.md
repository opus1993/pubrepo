Technology on its own will never be enough. To have a tangible, sustainable impact on decision making we actually have to build teams of people. This post covers highlights from this week in the world we all work in, including:

-   Gatekeeping,
-   Service provider **We Predict**,
-   A panel on building teams,
-   Upcoming events,
-   What will it mean to farm in the future?,
-   and data engineering

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

## Gatekeeping

The glitzy marketing side of data science has a really combative vibe. One might think that when you make it to the 'inner circle' through all the gatekeeping, you'll get to be a person doing 'magic' for insight-hungry stakeholders. There is an enormous empathy cliff to understand here. Folks are less hungry for data than they are hungry for *partnership* and genuine collaboration. There are lots of people in this world trying to use data as a means to an end, no doubt. But there is a growing awareness of all the ways data science disappoints, and there are so many options for how this all works. 

There are agendas at work in telling us who gets access, who gets to be smart, who gets to be technical, who gets to use what. Our community of practice has to push back on the gatekeeping and be much more open. If that makes it less "magic," so be it. (adapted from [Dr. Cat Hicks](https://twitter.com/grimalkina/status/1395058552260075522))

The proprietary walled gardens of SAS, Salesforce, Matlab and others are beginning to crumble. I do wonder if this is a factor.

## Building Teams

<p><a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/mw2npdn8tg?wvideo=mw2npdn8tg"><img src="https://embedwistia-a.akamaihd.net/deliveries/d1d1a2935346ad9debd72a5e844174bf.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;image_crop_resized=960x540&amp;image_play_button=1&amp;image_play_button_color=71a5d4e0" width="400" height="225" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;"></a></p>

Data science leaders from Warner Music Group, T-Mobile, Saturn Cloud, The Looma Project, and Caliber Home Loans talk in [this recent expert panel](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/building-effective-data-science-teams/) about what it takes to build successful data science teams and deliver value.

- How their teams prioritize and deliver work in a way that adds value to their organizations, while also maintaining credibility even when the results aren’t necessarily good news.
- Their advice for advancing your own data science career and collaborating with non-data-science stakeholders.

## Data Engineering

The critical thing to know about data engineering for analytics is that by making data analysis and operations more efficient, it unlocks a huge number of use cases that were impractical before. Out in startup world - this probably isn't huge news. Many have already recognized the value and importance of analytics engineering. That's going to continue and accelerate. There are huge potential applications in research, in academia, and in civic life. The big story of the past decade has been a lot of organizations drowning in data and unsure how to manage it all. Analytics engineering presents an answer to that question.

So [what makes a data analyst excellent?](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-makes-a-data-analyst-excellent-17ee4651c6db)

The answer:  speed.

Is the infrastructure and governance in place today optimized for speed? I've often thought that benchmarking our incumbent analysts, in any functional group setting, would provide an executive team with important strategic information, that they often lack when sitting across from software salespeople.
