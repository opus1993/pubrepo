[#SLICED](https://www.notion.so/SLICED-Show-c7bd26356e3a42279e2dfbafb0480073) is the hot new real time data science competition hosted by [Nick Wan](https://twitter.com/nickwan) and [Meg Risdal](https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal). Each Tuesday evening four of the best  in the business live-code for two hours to explore, analyze, and model a never-seen Kaggle dataset for points and prestige. 

A sizable fan base watches and interacts with the hosts via chat, with a little bit of snark and fun mixed in. Learning about the contestants backgrounds gives the sense that there is room here for everyone in the community. The best part of #SLICED is that YOU as a viewer can participate with the same starting dataset. There are not many places where you can learn how your skills and tools stack up against others this way. 

One of the contestants this week was [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge), a physics and astronomy PhD that today works as a software engineer. In this [recent podcast](https://nssdeviations.com/134-special-guest-julia-silge?tdest_id=743150), she was interviewed on the tools her team is developing and how they envision them being applied in data science curricula and in industry. She reflects on [a recent panel conversation with executives](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/building-effective-data-science-teams/) where the maturity of the team and the maturity of the data science field more broadly is measured more by doing the work that matters, by effective communications, and by strategic thinking.

In this week's post it leads me to the question:  

> Just what is an expert in this field, anyway?

Whatever prompted you to read this, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work. The content:

## Data Science Education

The [Harvard Data Science Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/) (HDSR) has hosted a diverse series of thought provoking articles on Data Science Education. The DS world has advanced so far since [Breiman's 2001 Two Cultures paper](http://staff.pubhealth.ku.dk/~tag/Teaching/share/material/Breiman-two-cultures.pdf), where he observed the diverging centers of thought in academia between what we know today as statistics versus data science. This is a new field. Recall that DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher were the first titled “data scientists,” in about 2011. Breiman closes with:

> The roots of statistics, as in science, lie in working with data and checking theory against data. I hope in this century our field will return to its roots. There are signs that this hope is not illusory. Over the last ten years, there has been a noticeable move toward statistical work on real world problems and reaching out by statisticians toward collaborative work with other disciplines. I believe this trend will continue and, in fact, has to continue if we are to survive as an energetic and creative field. 

In [Tim Harford](https://twitter.com/TimHarford)'s [How to Make the World Add Up](https://timharford.com/books/worldaddup/), one of his "ten rules for thinking differently about numbers" emerges from the shockwaves from the ~2005+ reproducibility crisis and how all academic disciplines have been forced to rethink and raise their evidentiary standards since then. Today, rather than being an obscure department buried within mathematics, data science aims to be a scientifically rigorous and globally impactful multidisciplinary field based on the principled and purposed production, processing, parsing and analysis of data.

### Experts are made, not born

[The journey to superior performance is neither for the faint of heart nor for the impatient](https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert) (2007, HBR). The development of real expertise requires struggle and honest, often painful self-assessment. Individual accounts of expertise are notoriously unreliable, as demonstrated by measurable, consistently superior performance. 

The idea that you can improve performance by relaxing and “just trusting your gut” is popular in some circles. While it may be true that intuition is valuable in routine situations, informed intuition is the result of deliberate practice. No-one will consistently improve their ability to make decisions without considerable practice, reflection, and analysis.

Many hope that they will suddenly improve performance by adopting a better method, just as an amateur golfer would think that they can improve their scores with a new golf club. But changing to a different club will likely increase the variability of the golfer’s shots. In reality, the key to improving expertise is consistency and carefully controlled practice.

Note too that knowledge management systems rarely, if ever, address expertise. They are repositories of images, documents, and routines: external data that people can view and interpret as they try to solve a new problem or make a decision. There are no shortcuts.

[Caitlin Hudon](https://twitter.com/beeonaposy)'s 2018 post on [imposter syndrome](https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/01/19/imposter-syndrome-in-data-science/) offers four points of advice on navigating career growth in this rapidly changing field:

1) Get comfortable with "I don't know"

1) Don't "fake it 'till you make it"

1) Encourage questions

1) Share what you're learning

### To become an expert, you need mentors

I frequently write in these posts about the importance of rigor. Mentors are important for *supervising* practice to achieve rigor. A good mentor will help to analyze performance, find mistakes, and offer advice to focus practice efforts.

A community of practice provides connections with other practitioners on tools, methods and  potential future mentors. Going it alone is very difficult. Most will need different mentors at different stages of development. In the beginning, a local teacher or club will be sufficient. As progress is made, data science practitioners will need to upgrade to more advanced mentors. The concepts needed to thrive in the 2030's will be even more advanced than those taught now. 

### Tool builders and tool users

We also get hung up over expertise semantics between the tool builders and the tool users. The authors of [On Democratizing Data Science: Some iNZights Into Empowering the Many](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/8fxt1zop/release/1?readingCollection=3572f4eb) rightly observe that ‘Do it yourself’ is bad practice when well-tested software already exists. 

Generalists and part-time statisticians are time-poor and may have little data-related education. Addressing the lack-of-knowledge problem runs headlong into the lack-of-time problem. Generalists do many different things and tend to rarely work in niche statistical modes. 

We live in a world where software producers are continually making things easier and more accessible for everyone. The whole R-package culture is about this, with many parallels in Python. Anything useful that can be automated will be automated, especially where ‘**good-enough, fast**’ trumps ‘**better but slower**.’

[Moez Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/profile-moez/)'s [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) is an example of a rapidly deployable low-code python framework. [Lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) facilitates fast and easy data exploration. For the generalist, or the citizen data scientist, these tools are a great entry point. On the other hand, with code review and statistical rigor, some business teams have challenges where a tool-builder might draw more detailed insights and possibly find a better algorithm.

## The Apex Predator of Strategy

An effective Chief Data Scientist is

1) the expert technical resource with a solid track record of hands-on production solution-building. They have the confidence of the entire business, with full credibility and authority. They also set the standards for and own the assessment of analytics maturity, cross-functionally across the enterprise.

1) an evangelist. They travel the entire organization and explain how data science could be used to make the organization comfortable with the strategy. 

1) a leader of a small, high-impact team. They must build the unit and make it more efficient and more effective, both in building products directly and in mentoring the dotted-line staff embedded out in functional groups.

1) a chief strategist, building the AI strategy for the company in the pursuit of leverage in competitive zero sum marketplaces with limited resource pools. Obviously, the enterprise expects to exploit advantages, to compete in arenas where they enjoy an edge. To to this, models are developed for planning, mapping customer engagement, and understanding contingencies for the dynamics of the marketplace. When successfully leveraging machine learning, the business changes.

I am re-stating some of the points from an [earlier post](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/2021-03-26-data-evangelist-part-5/) because C-suites (CEO/CIO/CFO/CTO...) are absolutely overwhelmed by powerpoint hand-wavers.

In contrast, the data science team has evidence and robust, rigorous processes, and as such are the most powerful strategic practitioners in the enterprise. Each data scientist is at the rare intersection of evidentiary, experimentally driven thesis and execution.

🚨 sarcasm ahead 🚨

Coming full circle back to the #SLICED competition, the near term choices that a data scientist makes, like the use of python, or a specific cloud service, or a software, are all tactics. If it's on #SLICED, its two hours of entertaining tactics.

Experts create a culture of mentorship and growth. Experts do work that has impact. Experts communicate effectively. And experts think strategically.

## Buzzword Bingo

So many sales pitches in the data and analytics space today are ridiculously bad. This one is not unusual:

{{<tweet 1402478408081186817>}}

I really do not understand and have no interest in what their offering is. That is, I didn't until [JD Long](https://twitter.com/CMastication)'s tweet:  :eyes:

{{<tweet 1399298124896686090>}}

He goes on to write: "And this is where I got the idea for my new company offering Scapegoat as a Service! Every statement of work comes with a promise to take the fall and never sue."
