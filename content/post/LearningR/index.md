The sheer volume of today’s data presents real challenges for businesses and opportunities for those who can analyze and explain it. The entry point for most professionals is Microsoft Excel. At some point, though, project requirements and organizations require more. The breakdowns are typically:

1. We need to separate the data from the analysis, with storage, for a single source of truth

1. We need to be able to automate the analysis

1. We need the analysis to be reproducible

1. We should not pay a third party obscene amounts of money for something as basic as arithmetic. The budget is better allocated towards innovation and staff education.

There are a number of solutions on the market that address these needs in various ways. Some are platforms, like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. Others are suites of software tools, like SAS or Matlab. One of the most widely used tool stacks for analysts is built on the R language.

The mothership for all things R is the [R project](https://www.r-project.org/) site. From there an analyst can download R for your platform, discover add-on packages, documentation, and source code as well as research other resources. There are many, many books about learning and using R. The R project site itself contains an extensive bibliography of books related to R.

Among my recommendations, the [R Cookbook 2nd Edition](https://rc2e.com/index.html#other-resources) by J.D. Long and Paul Teetor is a wonderful deskside reference. Many of their examples, or recipes, are included in this web resource. Of course, there are likely several reasonable solutions to each problem. This is a cookbook, not a bible. Example code and data are posted at the [R Cookbook GitHub](https://github.com/CerebralMastication/R-Cookbook)

[R for Data Science](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (O’Reilly), is a solid introduction to the Tidyverse, especially for using them in data analysis and statistics. It is also available free, online at [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

The [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd ed., by Winston Chang](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920063704.do) is indispensible for creating graphics. The book *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham (Springer)* is the definitive reference for the graphics package ggplot2.

Anyone doing serious graphics work in R will want *R Graphics by Paul Murrell (Chapman & Hall/CRC)*. 

[How Charts Lie](https://www.amazon.com/How-Charts-Lie-Getting-Information/dp/1324001569) and [Factfulness](https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness/) each speak to how numbers are very persuasive, and so are charts, because we associate them with science and reason. Charts can enlighten and enable conversations, allowing us to peek through the complexity of large amounts of data. Good charts make us smarter.

The use of git and GitHub are important for team collaboration. Find Jenny Bryan’s web book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/).

[R in a Nutshell, by Joseph Adler (O’Reilly)](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596801717), is another quick tutorial and reference you’ll keep by your side. Consider [Hands On Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund (O’Reilly) for an introduction, or The Art of R Programming by Normal Matloff (No Starch Press)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-programming-with/9781449359089/). Hadley Wickham’s *Advanced R Programming* is available either as a printed book or free online and is a great deeper dive into advanced R topics. [Efficient R Programming, by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace (O’Reilly)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920047995.do), is another good guide to learning the deeper concepts about R programming.
