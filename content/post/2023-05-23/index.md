Navigating a big career transition is a complex, ever-changing process. There is so much information to take in.  

I'm finding myself re-tracing 

Simon Sinek's TED talk

> There are leaders and there are those who lead.

> Leaders hold a position of power or influence.

> Those who lead inspire us.

> Whether individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead not because we have to, but because we want to.

> We follow those who lead not for them, but for ourselves.





Negotiating a compensation package

Hacking the online application process

Managing emotions, optimism

## Networking

1. There are two meetups downtown in Chicago this week that I'll trek in on the train for. 

2. Out of my 2000+ 1st degree connections in LinkedIn, some 700-ish are with good people at my previous employer.  But the more valuable ones to me today are in the 1300, particularly those that have made recent moves and understand the post-COVID hiring landscape. It's too bad that LinkedIn doesn't offer the API that they used to for a deep dive analysis.

## Recruiters
I nudged a couple people today about commencing with the outplacement support and advisory. A friend in fuels research that went through a similar process a few years back used outplacement to help start his consulting business.

My youngest is home from college for a couple weeks before she leaves for summer work. It's been a wonderful gift to have this time together.
