The one pager is a beautiful tool.

It’s one page. Enought for opening a conversation, bringing an idea to a persons’ mind. It contains a limited amount of language – 300 words or less if there is a chart or a handful of bullet points. Most people can read it in around 90 seconds. These are the constraints.

The one pager is simply a tool used to achieve goals. Let's start there, dive into each one, and conclude with a few experiences.

### Goals

Three foundational business goals are to persuade, to declare, and to engage.

Persuasion is often about convincing oneself, another, or a group to form a belief.

Declaration is often about sharing or proclaiming a decision, fact, opinion, problem, solution, situation, or belief.

Engagement may be to learn, collect, aggregate, or decide.

### Persuasion

Persuasion can either start with yourself or with others. If you understand why you, yourself, are persuaded by a given set of facts, you are in a better position to understand why others follow their own chain of inference to their conclusions. It may open you up to engage, and to be receptive to alternative arguments, assumptions and beliefs. That kind of self-knowledge is like the carbon that’s added to iron. It might seem soft, but when combined with cold fact, it makes the steel that much stronger.

Persuasion can sometimes start with others. You may find yourself having to connect two people, assisting one person to express their position in a way that the other will find persuasive.

Persuasion without belief is trolling. And I suppose the one pager is as good of a tool to troll as any. Great trolling requires solid self-knowledge. That may form part of the boundary of satire.

Try using the first draft of a one pager to convince yourself. Once you’re convinced, start another draft that is designed to persuade others. You can gradually select the words or rally facts that are  more likely to generate pleasant waves of responsiveness.

Just as letters have fonts, inasmuch as the way they are shaped will impart an effect, so do words. Even though words like *tradeoff*, *dilemma*, and *contradiction* all roughly mean the same thing, the shape of each word causes different people to respond differently.

For instance, the use of the word *dilemma* may resonate with people that have nostalgia for certain eras, and it may alienate people who do not, and it may confuse others. The word *tradeoff* may trigger feelings of anger in a person who perceived the word as weaponized from their past. Their memory of their experiences is what gives these words their shapes, and evokes different responses accordingly.

You get about 300 words in a one-pager, a figure that feels both too narrow and too overwhelming.

### Declaration

Not all declarations are designed to persuade. A declaration may instead be simply a power signal. This abuts up on the relationship between power and consent.

The degree to which consent must be secured through persuasion is a function of power. Maybe there’s a perception that power is eternal, as through once the electrons in iron are all aligned that the magnetic force is permanent. Maybe there’s a perception that power must be continuously renewed, and the use of persuasion is a way to replenish it. Your perception may inform how deliberate you are in structuring your one-pager in a way that is designed to purely declare or persuade.

At an extreme, a dictator can make outlandish claims, that they themselves know are a lie, and the people watching them know they’re lying, as a pure demonstration of power. “Look at my power — I can lie to you and you have to cheer me on.” The goal of such declarations seems to be simply a lavish demonstration of power.

As humans, we all have the innate right, the power, to make declarations. We are not automatically granted the right to be believed or the right to force others to believe. We may be granted, with the consent of others, the opportunity to persuade.

As individuals, we form organizations that moderate the associated power attached to those declarations. Some of those organizations have checks and balances to moderate power. Some of them pull all power into the very top and rely on the superior judgement of superiors to act expeditiously. Others deliberately organize power in a such a way to maximize an objective, some dependent variable, over some time span. Others are less deliberate. A tremendous amount of social technology goes into setting and tuning mandate levels. In Western liberal societies, we have the individual power to consent or withdraw our consent to be subjects. 

A one pager may serve as a proclamation of a decision. “Here-yay, Here-yay, Here-yay, I doth declare that the register button shall be red, #9E1A1A!"

A one pager may be used to make another form of proclamation. “Hey, look over here, there’s a *problem* over here, and it is worth exploring a *solution* for it.” You can swap the words problem and solution and the sentence still means the same thing. Your response to that declaration is interesting to note. Indeed, you could substitute the word problem and solution for any of belief, opinion, situation, fact, and opinion and it will likely mean roughly the same thing.

### Engagement

The one-pager is a fantastic tool for engagement.

Inviting a group of people to collaborate on the construction of a one-pager will generate a feeling of excitement – that we’re going to work on something together, under the narrow constraint and divergent freedom of 300 glorious words.

It’s a way to collect perspective and language from a set of people that has more degrees of freedom than a focus group survey, but not so wide as a full blown blank slate.

It provides a definitive end-point from which consensus may emerge.

It can be a fantastic way to learn from one another, including the way that people construct their mental models of the world, and how they forget their constraints.

Engaging in such is often slower than pure declaration and pure persuasion. But indeed, the act of engagement itself can be persuasive.

### Observations

One-pagers are great tools. They don’t even come close to powerpoint as a communication vehicle. They’re accessible. They’re brief. They get the job done efficiently because they reduce the surface area for discourse to the most important area. You don’t need to engage debating about what colours or photos to use, or if the kerning on the letter T looks off to you. You know when the one-pager is going to be over because you can see the bottom of the page right there. The whole one-pager is basically a progress bar. They’re easier to machine translate into other languages. They’re about as close to pure linguistic content as you can get. They’re very flexible.

In my years, I have met divergent thinkers that chafe at the imposed constraints of one-pagers. The longer an engagement goes on, the odds that the divergent thinker declares that 300 words is not enough to capture all of these ideas approaches 1. Often they will not buy in. Be open. Be patient. Constraints aren’t fun, but they are essential. Sometimes it takes time to organize the feelings before facts can be organized.

If the audience for the one-pager are executive type thinkers, leading with the decision and enumerating the justification beneath it works very well.

If the audience are convergent thinkers, leading with a traditional story format of why, who, what, where, how, and when works well. It can provide the kind of logical certainty that a convergent thinker finds comfortable.

If the audience are divergent thinkers, leading with what, then what is changing, and why it matters, works well.

If the audience are connectors, a tremendous amount of mileage can be gained with sourcing prior art. Acknowledge artifacts with tiny font at the bottom of the one-pager. Meeting connectors where they’re most comfortable and talking through the ripples can open new perspectives on the present.

Many audiences are heterogenous, made of up of a mix of those types of people, and others. Always give credit to those that participated in the creation of the one-pager.

A lot can happen to your mind in 60 to 90 seconds. 

A one-pager holds the promise that a lot can change. 

Isn’t that useful and beautiful?
