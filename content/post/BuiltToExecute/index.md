### [More and more top level enterprises have strategies that expect to exploit artificial intelligence.](https://fortune.com/packages/special-report-artificial-intelligence/) Companies are investing vast sums into data-hungry systems in the belief that they will profoundly transform the business landscape. Revenue projections are increasingly dependent on delivering on complex projects. Let’s explore the attributes of better AI teams and how they are built to execute.

Every business comes into machine learning and AI expecting the technology to grow the bottom line. The machine learning team is challenged then to create processes, build relationships, and deploy infrastructure to more than meet the need. 

As hard as building the team sounds, the hardest part in a non-[FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) enterprise is building the case for the expense and effort. Clearly there must be obvious and significant value delivered to the business. **Obvious** is the most important part. The cost and effort can only be supported by belief in the need and the technology. What does it take for a retail, agricultural, manufacturing, or medical company to decide to adopt a **machine learning first** business model? Consider what it took for Walmart to shift their business model to become a machine learning focused technology company.  By now it is fair to say that competing with Amazon drove the shift. 

Not every business has an obvious threat to their continued operations from a **machine learning first** competitor, today. Likely though, every business will eventually have a threat from a **machine learning first** competitor. Companies often find it difficult to make the transition from thinking about advanced analytics as a *source of innovation* to a *critical source of business value.* 

Simply having a machine learning team does not mean the business can list machine learning as a strength. Building a better machine learning team begins an evolution of moving the technology into the strength box. Having a machine learning team does not automatically mean the business is able to exploit every opportunity. 

Why do so many businesses struggle to realize the full value of their machine learning projects? [The answer appears to lie in the gap between applying it in pockets versus applying it at scale.](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-122/Accenture-Ready-Set-Scale.pdf) This post explores three key areas of focus of the better teams:

**1.	Relationships**

Relationships must always come first. Proof of concepts do not build long term equity. They feel like one and done. Do not assume that if the functional business unit is using machine learning, that their products are AI and the mission is accomplished.

Six months, sometimes longer, after the first project, machine learning will likely be a larger part of the business strategy. The machine learning team comes back to the functional business unit with a new project. 

Often there is a sense of, “I thought we already went through this. Why do it again?”

The interactions go like this:

*ML team:* We are going to build this for you.

*Functional Business Unit:* Why?

*ML Team:* It will improve things just like the first project did.

*Functional Business Unit:* We stopped using that. It stopped working.

*ML Team:* Why is this the first time we are hearing this?

*Functional Business Unit:* You didn’t ask. You had already moved on to the next project. 

There is always a reluctance for business units to talk with senior leadership about failures. Who wants to be the one to tell the CTO that their shiny new project flopped? Messengers get shot. They get called dinosaurs and told to adapt or die.

Building a better machine learning team starts with maintaining neglected relationships. Rebuilding broken prototypes. Listening to business needs and how the first project came up short. The next machine learning project usually involves cleaning up the first one.

Core competencies like communications, collaboration, business acumen, relationship building, and requirements gathering may be missing in the early versions. The first data scientists are always brought in for strong technical skills. Soft skills were thought to be a nice to have and not core to the team’s mission.

The business intelligence analysts embedded in the functional group are certainly part of the solution. They have relationships, the business acumen and solid technical skills. They should be expected to be the connection between stakeholders and the machine learning team. No company today has enough in-house ML talent. A smart Chief Learning Officer (CLO) knows that the job is to *curate*, rather than to *create* content, and then to establish processes to ensure that employees have opportunities and incentives to grow.

Leaders need to build ongoing structured forums for communication. Machine Learning Scientists should talk about how the technology is evolving with all business units. The goal is to explain what kinds of problems could be addressed. That understanding will often lead to the business unit proposing projects, with more clearly articulated needs.

At the same time, members of the business team should talk about their roles in the business, along with challenges and low skill, repetitive tasks. The goal here is knowledge transfer on how the unit operates and how value is delivered. The machine learning team must measure their solutions with an understanding of real-world operations, and start building for the user instead of themselves.

**2.	Roadmap**

This is the beginning of relationship building and repair. For successful, long term relationships, the machine learning team needs to execute. Machine learning products need to meet the same standards as any other product. The label does not exempt the team from on time, on budget, and as functionally specified projects.

Second phase machine learning projects are more complex. The first phase will not normally require much of a framework or cadence. The attitude is, “Let’s see if this works and go from there.” It is hard to manage a project when the machine learning team is running agile but no one outside the team understands the tasks.

The project team holds a kickoff meeting:

*Project team:* We need you to build... Here is the use case.

*ML team:* OK. We will look this over and get back to you.

2 weeks later:

*Project team:* Did you get a chance to look it over?

*ML team:* Yes. We can get started on it next sprint.

*Project team:* Great. Can you give me a deliverable list and timeline?

*ML team:* A what? We really won’t know until we get into it.

This is where having the right kinds of talent comes in. Machine Learning Scientists can take a project from problem statement to production. That does not mean they do all the work. Their efforts are focused on steps that happen while building the machine learning product roadmap.

Typically, the Principal Machine Learning Scientist sits in on strategy planning meetings. They understand the business problems and the goals for growth. What makes them different is their ability to hear a goal and say, “Machine learning could be part of the solution.” The strategy team can prioritize goals for project evaluation. Here’s where roadmap planning starts.

The Principal Machine Learning Scientist's research falls under each of these gates:

**•  The Problem Space:** “Is this even a machine learning problem?”

**•  The Solution Space:** “Does the team have the capabilities needed to implement this approach?”

**•  The Data:** “Does the business have enough/the right data to support the approach? What additional data needs to be gathered?”

In reality, there is always an unstructured, unknown component to machine learning projects. Putting it into the planning phase prevents it from causing chaos in deployment timelines. This also puts control of green lighting each delivery phase in the hands of senior leadership. 

Once all three gates have been met, the project gets put on the machine learning product roadmap. The Principal Machine Learning Scientist can provide the team with detailed guidance on how to complete the project. This framework makes the machine learning development lifecycle a managed process. The lifecycle phases and implementation follow a structured framework with customizations for each team and business.

**3. Infrastructure**

The path to production for a proof of concept will always be a combined best effort. When the machine learning team does the forensics and investigates why the product did not work, they often find it was not implemented as designed. Sometimes the model was not deployed at all or there is a battery of static triggers where the ML model should be.

The machine learning development lifecycle and path to production are connected. Infrastructure must support each phase. While building a better machine learning team, leaders will eventually find that people with deeper technical skills are needed. 

I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that in 2020 the MLOps umbrella term is often a buzzword sales pitch. A professional Machine Learning Architect and Machine Learning Scientist have unique skills to stand up projects properly. They work closely together, and both have a complete view of what it takes to build, deploy, and maintain ML models. The Principal Machine Learning Scientist defines the infrastructure requirements. The Machine Learning Architect creates the architecture to support those requirements.

Machine learning products never exist in a vacuum. There are multiple points of integration with the business. The machine learning architecture includes development, production and user environments. Integration extends to usability. Requirements from outside of the machine learning team must be supported.

Architecture can sprawl to the point of becoming heavy, expensive, and disruptive to other groups. Simplification is the skill of a master Machine Learning Architect.

The Machine Learning Architect’s first job is clean up. Through experimentation in notebooks, Machine learning teams have a tendency to apply the worst in software practices. Prototype and proof of concept projects are completed using each data scientist’s tool kit of choice. The Machine Learning Architect customizes their technology stack without having to build everything from the ground up.

Custom model development leads to environment customizations. Connecting the machine learning tools environment with development and user environments requires further customization. [Open source](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/open-source/) tools allow the machine learning team to add features supporting specific development needs, driving companies to contribute to open source projects and sometimes even launching their own projects. The benefit here ultimately comes from the open source community adding features and improvements.

The Machine Learning Engineer is responsible for implementation, starting with data gathering, so their role supports the Principal Machine Learning Scientist. On the other side of the machine learning development lifecycle, they work with Machine Learning Scientists to build optimization libraries for the team to use. These reduce model development, training, and validation times.

The Machine Learning Engineer takes a completed model and integrates it with the development or user environment. After deployment, they work with Machine Learning Scientists to maintain and improve models.

The scope of capabilities required to build the infrastructure and move machine learning products through the development lifecycle is broad. A single Machine Learning Engineer is rarely tasked with every step. As architectures become more complex, a diverse set of Machine Learning Engineer skill sets are needed.

### Conclusion

There may be a false sense of security that comes from just having a machine learning team on the organization chart. Does the team produce complete functional products? Do those products deliver a business need and align with a strategic goal? Do those products make it into users’ hands? What is the ROI and who is accountable for meeting targets? 

For many businesses, building a better machine learning team is central to achieving top level goals as a core component of business strategy. The three steps covered here, Relationships, Roadmap, and Infrastructure, are the simplest breakdown of the focus required to deliver.
