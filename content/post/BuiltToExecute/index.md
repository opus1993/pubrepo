### [More and more top level enterprises have strategies that expect to exploit artificial intelligence.](https://fortune.com/packages/special-report-artificial-intelligence/) Companies are investing vast sums into data-hungry systems believing that they will profoundly transform the business landscape. Their revenue projections are increasingly dependent on delivering on ever more complex projects. Let’s explore the attributes of better AI teams at a handful of firms and how they are built to execute.

Every business comes into machine learning and AI expecting the technology to grow the bottom line. The machine learning team is challenged then to create processes, build relationships, and deploy infrastructure to more than meet the need. Leaders that are new to the fields pour over whitepapers from Gartner and others to become familiar with the jargon.

INFORMs has published a [comprehensive guide](https://www.informs.org/Explore/Building-Successful-O.R.-and-Analytics-Teams) for leaders who want to get started with or enhance analytics implementation in their organizations. It provides frameworks and tools to answer questions like:

**•** What is the analytic maturity of the organization?

**•** What goals should be set for your analytics effort to create positive impact aligned with the organization’s strategy and objectives?

**•** Should the organization have a centralized or a decentralized analytics team?

**•** What funding is required?

**•** How can we identify, hire and develop the best talent for your analytics team(s)?

**•** What are best practices for structuring managing analytics projects?

**•** How can you enable your analytics effort to sustain and grow over time? 

The content presented in this post draws further on my own experiences in a large company. As hard as building the team sounds, the hardest part in a non-[FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) enterprise is building the case for the expense and effort. Clearly there has to be obvious and significant value delivered to the business. **Obvious** is the most important part. The cost and effort can only be supported by a belief in the need. What does it take for a retail, agricultural, manufacturing, or medical company to decide to adopt a **machine learning first** business model? Consider what it took for Walmart to shift their business model to become a machine learning focused technology company.  By now it is fair to say that competing with Amazon drove the shift. 

Not every business has an obvious threat to their continued operations from a **machine learning first** competitor, today. Likely though, every business will eventually have a threat from a **machine learning first** competitor. Companies often find it difficult to make the transition from thinking about advanced analytics as a *source of innovation* to a *critical source of business value.* 

Simply having a machine learning team does not mean the business can list machine learning as a strength. Building a better machine learning team begins an transformation that gradually moves the technology towards the strength box. Having a machine learning team by itself does not automatically mean the business is able to exploit every opportunity well. 

Why do so many businesses struggle to realize the full value of their machine learning projects? [The answer appears to lie in the gap between applying it in pockets versus applying it at scale.](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-122/Accenture-Ready-Set-Scale.pdf) This post explores three key areas of focus of the better teams:

**1.	Relationships**

Relationships must always come first. Proof of concepts do not build long term equity. They feel like one and done. Do not assume that if the functional business unit is using machine learning, that the mission is accomplished.

Six months, sometimes longer, after the first project, the machine learning team will come back to the functional business unit with a new project. Often there is a sense of, “I thought we already went through this. Why do it again?”

There is always a reluctance for business units to talk with senior leadership about the failures. Who wants to be the one to tell the CTO that their shiny new project flopped? Messengers are told to adapt.

Building a better machine learning team starts with maintaining neglected relationships and rebuilding the broken prototypes. Listen to the business' needs and how the first project came up short. The next machine learning project usually involves cleaning up the first one.

Core competencies like communications, requirements gathering, collaboration, and business acumen may be missing in the early team competencies. The first data scientists at an enterprise are always brought in for strong technical skills. Soft skills were thought to be a nice to have and not core to the team’s mission.

Often the work involved in building trust, or even culture, doesn't start neatly with a clearly defined end state. It is messy with organic bottom up efforts combining with top down efforts over a period of change that's driven as much by external forces as by any single decision to begin. This means that measuring success happens while the work is being done.

The business intelligence analysts embedded in the functional group are certainly part of the solution. They have relationships, the business acumen and solid technical skills. They should be expected to be the connection between stakeholders and the machine learning team. No company today has enough in-house ML talent. A smart Chief Learning Officer (CLO) knows that the job is to *curate*, rather than to *create* content, and then to establish processes to ensure that employees have opportunities and incentives to grow.

Leaders need to build ongoing structured forums for communication. Machine Learning scientists should talk about how the technology is evolving with all business units. The goal is to explain what kinds of problems could be addressed. That understanding will often lead to the business unit proposing projects, with more clearly articulated needs.

At the same time, members of the business team should talk about their roles in the business, along with challenges and low skill, repetitive tasks. The goal here is knowledge transfer on how the unit operates and how value is delivered. The machine learning team must measure their solutions with an understanding of real-world operations, and start building for the user instead of themselves.

**2.	Roadmap**

The machine learning team needs to build a track record, satisfying the same standards as any other product offering. The label does not exempt the team from the dimensions of on time, on budget, and of functionally for any other projects. The organizational expects clarity in articulating goals for a positive business impact.

Second phase machine learning projects are often more complex than the first pass. The first phase will not normally require much of a framework or cadence. The attitude is, “Let’s see if this works and go from there.” Consider what happens with a project when the machine learning team is running agile but no one outside the team understands the tasks.

This is where having the right kinds of talent comes in. Machine Learning scientists can take a project from problem statement to production. That does not mean they do all the work. Their efforts are focused on steps that happen while building the machine learning product roadmap.

Sources of stakeholder involvement that must be understood in building the roadmap:

**Analytics Producers**: those who do the work of analyzing data and developing decision support systems that leverage analytics techniques for making better decisions.

**Analytics Consumers**: the members of the organization that will be responsible for executing the results of the analytical work.

**Analytics Champions**: the leaders in the organization that act as sponsors of projects. They typically lead a component of the organization that will benefit from the application of analytics.

**Analytics Enablers**: the supporting parts of an organization, such as information technology, data stewards, and graphical user interface designers, who provide supporting functions for successful analytics projects.

Typically, the Principal Machine Learning Scientist sits in on strategy planning meetings. They understand the business problems and the goals for growth. What makes them different is their ability to hear a goal and say, “Machine learning could be part of the solution.” The strategy team can prioritize goals for project evaluation. Here’s where roadmap planning starts.

The Principal Machine Learning scientist's research falls under each of these gates:

**•  The Problem Space:** “Is this even a machine learning problem?”

**•  The Solution Space:** “Does the team have the capabilities needed to implement this approach?”

**•  The Data:** “Does the business have enough/the right data to support the approach? What additional data needs to be gathered?”

In reality, there is always an unstructured, unknown component to machine learning projects. Putting it into the planning phase prevents it from causing chaos in deployment timelines. This also puts control of green lighting each delivery phase in the hands of senior leadership. 

Once all three gates have been met, the project gets put on the machine learning product roadmap. The Principal Machine Learning scientist can provide the team with detailed guidance on how to complete the project. This framework makes the machine learning development lifecycle a managed process. The lifecycle phases and implementation follow a structured framework with customizations for each team and business.

Given the significant relationship between change management and analytics goals, the role of executive champions and sponsors becomes extremely important. For larger initiatives, steering committees that bring multiple stakeholders with multiple perspectives into the same conversation also becomes very important. Analytics tools and models often clarify and expose critical tradeoffs that may negatively impact one business function to achieve a net positive result for the larger organization. Executive sponsorship and forum for these critical discussions help to validate goal alignment. There is no short cut to the roadmapping process. 

**3. Infrastructure**

The path to production will always be a combined best effort. When the machine learning team does the forensics and investigates why the product did not work, they often find it was not implemented as designed. Sometimes the model was not deployed at all or it was replaced with a battery of static triggers where the ML model was.

A machine learning development lifecycle and the path to production are connected, on infrastructure. While building a better machine learning team, leaders will eventually find that people with deeper technical skills are needed. 

I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that in 2020 the MLOps software umbrella is largely a buzzword sales pitch. The professional Machine Learning Architect and the Machine Learning scientist have unique skills to stand up projects properly. Working closely together, both have a complete view of what it takes to build, deploy, and maintain ML models. The Principal Machine Learning scientist defines the infrastructure requirements. The Machine Learning Architect creates the architecture to support those requirements.

Machine learning products never exist in a vacuum with many points of integration into the business. The machine learning architecture encompasses development, production and user environments. Integration extends to usability. Many requirements from outside of the machine learning environment must be supported.

Architecture can sprawl to the point of becoming heavy, expensive, and disruptive to other groups. Simplification is the skill of a master Machine Learning Architect.

The Machine Learning Architect’s first job is clean up. Through experimentation in notebooks, data science teams have a tendency to apply the worst in software practices. Prototype and proof of concept projects are completed using each data scientist’s tool kit of choice. The Machine Learning Architect customizes their technology stack without having to build everything from the ground up.

Custom model development requires environment customizations. [Open source](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/open-source/) tools allow the machine learning team to add features supporting specific development needs, driving companies to contribute to open source projects and sometimes even launching their own projects. The benefit here ultimately comes from the open source community adding features and improvements.

The Machine Learning Engineer is responsible for implementation, starting with data gathering, so their role supports the Principal Machine Learning scientist. On the other side of the machine learning development lifecycle, they work with Machine Learning scientists to build optimization libraries for the team to use. These reduce model development, training, and validation times.

The Machine Learning Engineer takes a completed model and integrates it with the user environment. After deployment, they work with Machine Learning scientists to maintain and improve models.

The broad scope of capabilities required to build the infrastructure and move machine learning products through the development lifecycle is not immediately apparent to most businesses. As architectures become more complex, a more diverse set of Machine Learning Engineer skill sets are needed.

### Conclusion

There may be a false sense of security that comes from just having a machine learning team on the organization chart. Does the team produce complete functional products? Do those products deliver a business need and align with a strategic goal? Do those products make it into users’ hands? What is the ROI and who is accountable for meeting targets? 

For many businesses, building a better machine learning team is central to achieving top level goals as a core component of business strategy. The three steps covered here, Relationships, Roadmap, and Infrastructure, are the simplest breakdown of the focus required to deliver.
