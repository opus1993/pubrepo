Data are simply units of information, or artifacts. When analyzed properly they tell stories of unmet customer needs. For all the talk about digital or AI magic, the way we know that we are on the right path is simply in the way that customer needs are satisfied.

The drive to become more customer centric requires that our teams accelerate the velocity of delivery. This means that domain experts, engineers, scientists, marketers, managers and others need to level-set on speaking the same digital language. 

Many organizations continue to struggle to find the singular full-stack coding developer that can do it all. Organizations also struggle to upskill existing talent with state of the art data science tools. Many firms have under-invested in data skills and find themselves behind. For some businesses, the lack of these skills will become an existential problem. On that theme, this brief post will cover a few thoughts on

-   One Company's Decision to Put A.I. into The Ground,
-   The CIA’s' Simple Sabotage Field Manual' (1944),
-   Upcoming Events,
-   and a book recommendation.

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

## One Company's Decision to Put A.I. into The Ground

Don Vollmar asked me to travel to and investigate the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show for the first time in 2016 and write a report for our tractor platform teams. Every year in January some 170,000 tech industry insiders and media would descend on the vast convention center facilities along the famous strip. 

As Gideon Lewis-Kraus observes in his [Aventine article](https://www.aventine.org/artificial-intelligence/feature/john-deere), CES visitors might have been forgiven for concluding that the promise of artificial intelligence had at last been fully realized. Over the years, vendor exhibits grew beyond cameras and car radios to cover a huge range of smart devices, including autonomous automobiles, drones, streaming media, appliances, sensors, and more. 

General Motor's new CEO, [Mary Barra](https://twitter.com/mtbarra), delivered a keynote announcing that the company was to be a technology company. I confess that I too stood in line with many others to "drive" an autonomous BMW. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and SAE hosted a panel on smart roads, with new vehicle to infrastructure standards and universal toll collection devices to make roads much much safer. [Robin Chase](https://twitter.com/rmchase), co-founder of Zipcar, gave a talk on EV ride-share services and a new urbanization model. With zero car collisions, EV, and ride-share, entire economic segments, like car insurance and gas stations, were expected to soon become obsolete.

My condensed trip notes to Don reflected anxiety over mismatches between the conversations going on at CES, and those within our PD platforms and brands. Internally, we expected that drones, satellite imagery and maybe tablets could make the agronomic parts of agriculture smarter.

At CES, engineers anticipated that 4G/5G telematics and over the air updates would transform vehicle service experiences. At the same time, most were certainly also concerned with hacking, security, penetration testing, and the role of government in setting the lines for liability. Mining huge central stores of logged event data would also become a possibility, ranging from little insights like which podcasts the driver enjoyed all the way to watching driver behavior and giving immediate feedback. Would sensing driver condition, like sleepiness or cognitive overload, become the next safety feature? Would the EPA or other government agencies require calibrations or mobile emissions inspections now that it was technically feasible? If the automobile industry was addressing these issues, would heavy equipment be required to follow?

The two hundred plus year story of mechanized agriculture parallels the story of thermodynamics, illustrated in the book Einstein's Fridge (below). All of the great World's Fairs had halls celebrating technical progress in agricultural innovation. Harnessing energy at  scale for the harvest, for refrigeration, and for transport and trade has transformed lives and increased human potential in ways that are easy to take for granted today.

Twenty five years ago my colleagues worked together with firms in the newly commercialized satellite global positioning systems to outfit equipment with guidance and mapping capabilities. On a basic level, artificial intelligence is only the most recent chapter in a story of continuous mechanization. 

In 2018 a McKinsey & Company report noted that Artificial Intelligence 

> “may usher in radical — arguably unprecedented — changes in the way people live and work,” 

potentially creating additional economic output of around $13 trillion by 2030 and boosting global GDP by about 1.2 percent a year. A company that adopts AI quickly could see 

> “additional annual net cash flow growth of about 6 percent for more than the next decade.” 

The consultants’ message to C.E.O.s is clear: Move forward or be left behind. 

If the first step in “AI adoption” is to recognize that your customers have problems that lend themselves to deep-learning solutions, and the second is to prioritize those particular problems, the third is to build the kind of infrastructure that AI requires.

John Deere's Alex Purdy [explains](https://www.aventine.org/artificial-intelligence/feature/john-deere): 

> “A customer makes a hundred and forty decisions for each seed. I don’t know much about seed genetics, and I don’t want to. . . . When you take your data off your equipment at the end of the year — how much seed you put down, where you put it down, what you did to it, and your final yield — you can put it into DuPont Pioneer’s Granular system, and then your seed adviser will help you determine those seed choices for next year — which hybrid, how much to put down, where — and then you’ll work with an agronomist to develop a seed plan, a map, which by the end of the winter goes right back into your equipment.”

## The CIA’s' Simple Sabotage Field Manual' (1944)

The inner workings of many organizations may make more sense when viewed in the light of a set of instructions for “purposeful stupidity,” namely the once top-secret Simple Sabotage Field Manual, written in 1944 by the US CIA’s precursor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).

{{<tweet 1106489969529552896>}}

Now declassified, the manual the agency describes as “surprisingly relevant” was once distributed to OSS officers abroad to assist them in training “citizen-saboteurs” in occupied countries. Such people, [writes Rebecca Onion at Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2015/11/20/how_the_cia_encouraged_citizens_under_occupation_to_sabotage_their_workplaces.html), “might already be sabotaging materials, machinery, or operations of their own initiative,” but may have lacked the devious talent for sowing chaos that only an intelligence agency can properly master. Genuine laziness, arrogance, and mindlessness may surely be endemic. But the Field Manual asserts that “purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature” and requires a particular set of skills. The citizen-saboteur “frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage.”

Laugh, then maybe shudder a little, recognizing how much places you have worked resemble the kind of mess the OSS meticulously planned for enemies during World War II.
