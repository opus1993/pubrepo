Every day executives and business professionals see digital technologies that could benefit their organization, but the connection between business problem and realizing business value is not well understood.

The reality today for most large enterprises is that they:

- have diverse individual customers, globally, with growing brand expectations. 

- offer ever more complex solutions - each with quality, lead time, conversion rate success and dozens of other success metrics.

- have growing complexity in managing the ethical and regulatory aspects of their digital offering.

- have many partner suppliers with their individual contributions to overall success.

- have lots of data...

The data has the potential to provide the fuel for the digital transformations to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.  The means of unlocking that value is not a so much role or set of skills (i.e. data scientist), but a way of working - a workflow.

Cassie Kosyrkov of Google, in a recent Harvard Business Review article titled [What Great Data Analysts Do — and Why Every Organization Needs Them](https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them):

"While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses, analysts are your best bet for coming up with those hypotheses in the first place. For instance, they might say something like “It’s only a correlation, but I suspect it could be driven by …” and then explain why they think that. This takes strong intuition about what might be going on beyond the data, and the communication skills to convey the options to the decision-maker, who typically calls the shots on which hypotheses (of many) are important enough to warrant a statistician’s effort. As analysts mature, they’ll begin to get the hang of judging what’s important in addition to what’s interesting, allowing decision-makers to step away from the middleman role."

Caitlin Malone and Ben Jaffe in their Linear Digressions podcast episode [Data Scientists: Beware of Simple Metrics](http://lineardigressions.com/episodes/2019/12/22/data-scientists-beware-of-simple-metrics) observe the critical role of business engagement:

"Picking a metric for a problem means defining how you’ll measure success in solving that problem. Which sounds important, because it is, but oftentimes data scientists only get experience with a few kinds of metrics when they’re learning and those metrics have real shortcomings when you think about what they tell you, or don’t, about how well you’re really solving the underlying problem.

A classic example of metrics run amok is the Wells Fargo debacle, where employees opened 3.5 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' consent in an effort to implement its now infamous "cross-selling" strategy. In addition to paying initial fines (`$185` million), reimbursing customers for fees (`$6.1` million), and eventually settling a class-action lawsuit to cover damages as far back as 2002 (`$142` million), Wells Fargo now faced strong headwinds in attracting new retail customers.

Analytics leaders create value by championing integrated, rigorous and ethical work, no matter the industry or the size of the team. They foster the tough conversations, asking the [sharp questions](https://brohrer.github.io/pocket_guide_data_science.html).
