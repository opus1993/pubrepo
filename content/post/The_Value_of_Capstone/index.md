Every day executives and business professionals see digital technologies that could benefit their organization, but the connection between business problem and realizing business value is not well understood.

The reality today for most large enterprises is that they:

- have diverse individual customers, globally, with growing brand expectations. 

- offer ever more complex solutions - each with quality, lead time, conversion rate success and dozens of other success metrics.

- have more complexity in managing the ethical and regulatory aspects of their digital offering.

- have many partner suppliers with their individual contributions to overall success.

- have data...

The data has the potential to provide the fuel for the digital transformations to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.  The means of unlocking that value is not a so much role or set of skills (i.e. data scientist), but a way of working - a workflow.

Cassie Kosyrkov of Google, in a recent Harvard Business Review article [What Great Data Analysts Do ‚Äî and Why Every Organization Needs Them](https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them):

"While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses, analysts are your best bet for coming up with those hypotheses in the first place. For instance, they might say something like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a correlation, but I suspect it could be driven by ‚Ä¶‚Äù and then explain why they think that. This takes strong intuition about what might be going on beyond the data, and the communication skills to convey the options to the decision-maker, who typically calls the shots on which hypotheses (of many) are important enough to warrant a statistician‚Äôs effort. As analysts mature, they‚Äôll begin to get the hang of judging what‚Äôs important in addition to what‚Äôs interesting, allowing decision-makers to step away from the middleman role."

The new Chicago area Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business MSBA Master's Degree Program is built to fill these needs. One of the faculty, Kevin Hartman of [Google, puts it this way](https://mendoza.nd.edu/news/google-it-bringing-big-data-to-the-classroom/):

‚ÄúThe way I teach analytics is informed by my business day job,‚Äù Hartman said. ‚ÄúThat is also why I don‚Äôt want to just impart practical knowledge to them, because that practical knowledge has a very short half-life. Things are moving so quickly. If I teach you how to do something today, that might not be relevant in a week or a year.‚Äù

The cohort-based in-person learning environment in downtown Chicago fosters deeper conversation and understanding of data, and the power behind data to make decisions. The program culminates with a hands-on capstone project where the team partners with a corporate sponsor on a real-world analytics project to put your knowledge and skills to work.
