## Employee Resource Groups

Want to make a difference in our organization and for those you work with? CNH Industrial is now accepting interest forms for the development of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) – a new channel for building communities that foster employee and organizational advancement.
 
What is an ERG?
ERGs are voluntary, employee-led organizations which foster diversity and inclusion in the workplace and are backed by leadership. Examples of ERGs include professional development groups and groups bringing together people with similar affinities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, veteran status, etc.). Employees are offered the opportunity to develop, lead and/or participate in them.
 
ERGs at CNH Industrial will strive to contribute to the following Six Pillars:

Networking
Professional Development
Diversity & Inclusion
Sustainability
Attraction & Retention of Talent
Customer Experience
