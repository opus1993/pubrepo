Recap the high points of the past several weeks



A movement / a following


Business leadership builds the strategy and targets. 

But they do not (and are not be expected to) have the technical acumen for every aspect of leading-edge AI. 

The executive team could seek outside consultancy for advice, like Gartner, but if CNH is going to lead, this competency needs to be built and led internally.


On that note, this short post explores 

- Talent
- Events
- Rigor
- learning resources, and
- 2 book recommendations.

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

[Agile at Scale at Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr)

OKRs are a refinement of a widely used practice of management by objectives (MBO). The difference is that OKRs are a more collaborative process as opposed to a top-down bureaucratic process. Peter Drucker – who first popularized MBO – suggested that a manager should review the organization's goals and then set the worker's objectives. In contrast, OKRs rely on the teams within the organization to take high-level objectives and refine them for each specific area. And if teams have to work with other partners in the organization to reach high-level objectives, those teams might collaborate and write OKRs together to ensure proper alignment. It’s a shift in mindset where the question changes from "were we busy doing the tasks?" to "did we move the needle for our organization to thrive?"

It’s more useful to think about the “OKR process” than it is to just consider the “objective” and the “key result” bits. Static goals that aren’t regularly reviewed and revised as the operating environment changes quickly become stale and meaningless. Combining clear objectives with a small set of specific, measurable results and a regular process of reviewing progress toward those measures is what makes OKRs truly useful.

Defining OKRs
OKRs have two important parts: The objective you want to achieve and the key results, which are the way you measure achieving the objective.

Early in every university statistics 101 course there is that moment when the professor delivers the line about what happens to the average income of the party when Bill Gates walks into the room. Of course, the story is a bridge to a conversation about the median and interquartile range.  Later, most students hear about Siméon Denis Poisson's estimation of the annual number of Prussian cavalry soldiers killed due to horse-kicks. If you are lucky, you might apply Poisson's distribution to modern examples like estimating the number of car crashes, or counts of fault code events. In modern econometrics and epidemiology the beta distribution and Bayesian techniques are front and center. 

Certain technologies are well-known around engineering organizations. Machine learning has its roots in statistical work.

This raises the question of whether an AI COE should be combined with analytics groups are already embedded into regional/functional groups.

If an existing analytics group is already practicing in predictive analytics, it stands to reason those skills could be applied to other AI projects, and a combined organization makes sense.

{{<tweet 1373979077674033155>}}

However, the same rigor and standards must be fulfilled everywhere.

Many functional groups and regional locations at CNH are attempting to hire analysts, data scientists, and data engineers today.

Though most functional groups are outsourcing those services.

The scarcity of talent and expertise means it is even more critical than other resource types to create a critical mass – a community.

We need to align our technical assessments of candidates for professional roles, and make it clear what knowledge is required to advance from a junior position to a senior position.

Finally, our job-posting requirements language must be unified and aligned with the industry, so we attract the right talent, and they understand the expectations of the roles.

## Rigor section

Align with the language of prior Evangelist letters

CNH has resources in various places for data governance and security review, and policies already.  

Some are overlapping. Some not widely known, or conformed to, leaving gaps.

There must be a champion for driving standards and rigor across the enterprise.

This means, prior to deployment, all work is subject to “peer review” by the business, including ethics. 

Peer review could easily be associated with GPD (or not).

It means statistical models must be retained, and AI model performance reviewed periodically by the business, post deployment.

To accelerate our work, we need a clean feature (data) catalogue.

More than anything, a clear champion for standards and rigor, must be identified.

This new role:  Principal Data Scientist

The expert in data science, responsible for helping others do data science

Four main responsibilities:

Strategy: lay out the plan for tackling data science problems. Is modeling a given business problem even feasible? Should a neural network be used?    
Setting Standards:  driving cross-functional co-ordination and synergy.
Mentoring:  facilitating knowledge transfer and dissemination of information/news
Finding solutions to the company’s most difficult problems.

Compared with a business manager, the principal data scientist is still very much doing data science work, reading technical papers, being part of the technical community. This role is all data science all the time.

‘Inclusive AI’ would recognize individuals for their achievements in advancing the state of the art in both digital literacy and in AI.

By Domain expertise and business acumen, Location, and even skill level

Especially as the state of the art advances. Given open source tools and compute resources, what can they build and share?

Employees at any career stage should be welcome to join and encouraged to opt-in, even for their own career development.

To make these as collaborative as possible, members should be expected to meet and share within their community of practice periodically.

Grouped by clusters, or affinity groups, with local champions and mentors to ensure that development advances.

----

As with Toastmasters, AI affinity groups are not meant to align with organizational silos. 

It is better affinity groups be geographically clustered and have a local champion that fosters extreme collaboration at periodic events.

They would take strategic direction from…


The Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence:

This core leadership team includes the leading experts, including the company’s principal data scientist. 

Among others, their prime deliverables to the business and AI community of practice are:

![Roles](figure_16-1.png)

Craft a vision for AI in the company.

It’s important for executives to discuss — ideally with AI experts — what AI is, what it can do, and how it might enable new business models and strategies. Otherwise, it may sub-optimize what AI can ultimately do for the business.

Identify highest-value business-driven use-cases. Developers of AI capabilities will need a prioritized list of applications or use cases within the company. They should balance strategic value with what is achievable. Companies may develop some of these use cases as pilots or prototypes, but they should also have a “pipeline” — regularly monitored by the AI center and by executives — that leads to robust production deployment.

Determine the appropriate level of ambition.

Since AI typically supports tasks rather than entire business processes, it is usually best to undertake less ambitious projects as opposed to “moon shots.” But in order to get management attention and have a substantial impact on the business, organizations may want to undertake a series of smaller projects in one area of the business. This requires a road map, showing multiple use cases across a timeline, with resources and dependencies. An AI center can help the company “think big, but start small.”

Create a target data architecture.

The vision and use-cases define the data platform and tools needed to deliver. This is key for all (data-relevant) projects, and all types of data — structured, unstructured, and external. SQL server is the standard data management platform today, but the AI center needs to decide between on-premises versus cloud variations, and self-maintained open source solutions versus licensed solutions. Most companies benefit from using user-ready analytics tools with open-source components enabling quick user-friendly modeling, rather than packaged tools that are rigidly BI-oriented.

Manage external innovation.

An AI center can orchestrate relationships with universities, vendors, AI start-ups, and other sources of expertise and innovation. The company can develop an AI ecosystem, and perhaps even invest in firms that show promise of adding value to the business. This is also important for the tools and technology to be best-in-class.
Facilitate on-going recruiting, attracting, and building talent. It is no secret that leading-edge AI engineers and data scientists (statisticians) are difficult to find, let alone hire.

Spread success stories.

A key success factor with AI or any new technology is to spread early success stories with prioritized use cases. This will build the appetite for more AI activity, in effect performing a marketing function for the AI center itself, and the AI talent group.

Develop and maintain a network of AI champions.

An AI center will work best if it cultivates a network of influential supporters and champions for the technology across the business. Given the commoditization of programming (with readily available scripts in languages like R- and Python), the focus for in-house capability building should be on statistical and mathematical modeling, in business-relevant, value-creating use-cases, rather than pure programming.
