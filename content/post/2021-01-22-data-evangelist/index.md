[R-Studio's annual global conference](https://global.rstudio.com/student/catalog) for 2021 came and went yesterday. This year's format was 24 hours of back to back simulcast talks, shared interest networking rooms, and opportunities to engage the speakers in discussions. As many as ~16,000 dialed in virtually, a figure quite a bit higher than the previous years' in-person conferences.

This post is intended to accomplish three things:  1) reflect on a handful of takeaways from the conference relevant to my own work this year, 2) link up several threads on working towards addressing diversity and inclusion, and 3) as most companies set annual employee development goals this time of year, make a call to action.

> If you are not familiar with R, take a moment to explore the [R-Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) web site and watch the 90 second video. Over 2 million users and hundreds of companies have joined to support an open source governance and foundation model. 

One track of talks at the conference featured topics on diversity, fairness, and inclusiveness. Speaking on these can be challenging because the issues manifest themselves both in our workplaces and in our work output, the algorithms and tools we build. Grant Fleming here is very much qualified to deliver this particular talk as an author and contributor to two recent books on fairness in machine learning and model explainability.

**Gulp** is right :flushed: 

The many failures in AI and data science in recent years should be well known by now. How many of you have received offers both from AI HR services that screen candidate resumes -AND- AI HR services that help write a better resume? For any one of the algorithms deployed, what could possibly go wrong, and who owns it? Who is the owner of the algorithms used where you work, and who sets the standards? Diversity and fairness must be addressed as a normal course of work processes, for processes that in many cases do not have guardrails yet.

In his time, [Sergio Marchionne](https://www.ft.com/content/6a813814-8ff3-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421) spoke often about his leadership framework. In a nutshell, if you left the company today, could you articulate the ways the organization, or customer experience, has been impacted because of your work? Ethical leadership requires that we go beyond an awareness of the potential issues and actually impart accountability, insight, and action. Successful examples in domains like STEM, agriculture, manufacturing, and even in the statistics community have been too few and far between.

Vicki Boykis gave a keynote address at the conference on empowerment. A synopsis:

On a related note, [Brian Popp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-popp-mba/) makes a compelling argument in his [How to Build a High-Performance Analytics Team](https://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Machine-Learning/events/275340419/) talk that we should be taking time to assess the curiosity of job candidates. Does the candidate have a trusted network of peers to bounce ideas off of? Some organizations host internal communities of practice, book clubs, or even Toastmasters chapters to bring out the best in their people. As the manager, we are committing to make a significant investment in building out both skills and the network for the new employee's success, so they are in a position to make positive contributions. 

I've observed that avid readers often exhibit a deeper sense of curiosity, going beyond doom-scrolling the echo-box of social media. Readers often can bring value to the organization making the greater impact on the non technical parts of the enterprise.

The ability to convey stories with a sense of our shared history makes the math come alive in more meaningful ways. Other probing questions:

- When is the last time that you helped someone with a request that they could have easily done themselves? 

- Do you use the ad-hoc engagements as opportunities to build relationships and advocate for new ways of working? 

- When and where has there been a stage and a receptive audience for data science?

Laura Ellis notes here that data evangelism is also the manager's role. Admittedly, every organization is at a different point in the data maturity journey. Besides eventually making colleagues self sufficient, the point of data evangelism is to strengthen both the technical team and promote awareness of the potential of data science across the enterprise.

Creating contexts for people to share their work and what they are learning builds those networks and development pathways. External stakeholders may also benefit from greater insight into what exactly the data science team does, and how they can help the company achieve all business objectives.

We all hope that the New Year 2021 marks an inflection point. Besides possibly returning to some sort of post-COVID-19 normalcy, our organization has a brand new CEO and a handful of new managers. All are asking questions about where the enterprise is with AI right now.

Rather than pointing to how many millions of dollars we are spending on outsourced services, we should be speaking to measures of maturity in data-driven decision making and the state of change management. How will our team members grow to make their unique impact on our processes and on our customer's experiences, in tangible ways, and not in just sample toys?

With the importance of data evangelism in mind, below are six ideas for initiatives to kick start the transformation of people and processes:

1. **Workshops**

Educating line of business stakeholders on SQL, advanced Excel, and R will lead to huge time savings on the ad-hoc requests. Other topics could include an overview of  business intelligence data visualization tools, or even a workshop describing the basics of how predictive models make decisions. The key here is to engage, educate and inspire colleagues to continue learning on their own. Having office hours during specific times of the week may be another useful way to keep engagement high and create time to answer questions. This way you can also batch questions, and avoid context switching during the week.

2. **Yammer newsletters and guest blogs**

With a newsletter, the focus can shift from internal topics (highlighting projects and internal team updates), external (industry trends), or a hybrid of the two. Having a way to communicate what your team is working on is a great way to raise awareness and coordinate action with others in the company. Similarly, highlighting developments in your field may lead to someone outside of your immediate team to come up with a novel idea worth exploring.

3. **Meetups**

New employees straight out of college can find it difficult to continue learning and staying on top of the latest developments. Meetups like [R in manufactuRing & consumeR products](https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup/events/275770080/) and the hundreds of local [R User Groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/r-user-groups/) can serve as useful accountability tools, bridging academia and industry. They may also lead to some interesting ideas that impact the business' technical roadmap.

4. **Learning Lunches**

Inviting internal or external speakers is a great way to get a fresh perspective and offer a platform for others to share what they are working on. The goal could be anything from highlighting unique insights from people outside of your team, to generating interesting discussions.

5. **Hackathons**

Opening your data to others in the company can be useful to brainstorm new ways to visualize data or different approaches to building predictive models. Sometimes it takes someone who has not seen the same data to come up with a novel insight.

6. **Documentation**

An important step in educating colleagues is writing documentation on topics that come up frequently. This will also be an valuable tool when on-boarding new teammates.

A culture which educates and empowers employees through data evangelism efforts will be one that will reap many benefits. Sometimes itâ€™s as simple as walking a business stakeholder through the mechanics of a model in production to get them to understand how it works, as opposed to having them think itâ€™s black-box magic. With increased transparency, business stakeholders may be more likely to cooperate and may even come up with new applications. These types of efforts will ultimately lead to increased credibility and trust. Without these two things, no matter how great the team's technical potential, the ability to impact the company will be limited.
