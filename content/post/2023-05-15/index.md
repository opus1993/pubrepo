As of mid-May, I've identified a handful of skills gaps to make some time to address.  I am learning that when the application asks for a target salary, put in $1 and have the discussion with the screener.  

## Networking

1. There are two meetups downtown in Chicago this week that I'll trek in on the train for. 

2. Out of my 2000+ 1st degree connections in LinkedIn, some 700-ish are with good people at my previous employer.  But the more valuable ones to me today are in the 1300, particularly those that have made recent moves and understand the post-COVID hiring landscape. It's too bad that LinkedIn doesn't offer the API that they used to for a deep dive analysis.

## Recruiters
I nudged a couple people today about commencing with the outplacement support and advisory. A friend in fuels research that went through a similar process a few years back used outplacement to help start his consulting business.

## A Parting Thought

My youngest is home from college for a couple weeks before she leaves for summer work. It's been a wonderful gift to have this time together.
