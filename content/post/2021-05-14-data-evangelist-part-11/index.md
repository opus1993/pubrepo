Bi-weekly Fleet and Farm flash demonstration event, global teams, end of spring showcase




In the news this month, 

My plan here is to explain why this fits with the mission and make a few observations about the rapidly expanding scope of digital in agriculture. I'll also throw in a handful of posts as seen on social media this week. On that theme, this brief post will cover:

-   A Book Recommendation,
-   Collaboration, Trust, Robustness, Sustainability, and Other Motivations,
-   Gartner Analytics Conference Debrief,
-   Upcoming Events,
-   and IIA Architecting a Modern Analytics Tech Stack Debrief.

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

The New Techinical Manager,   what do they need to know?              The care package tweet:

Lara Hogan on Twitter: "I created the New Manager Care Package to equip new managers with actionable tools for their 1st 30 days, alongside a little celebration of their accomplishment. 15% off until May 5: https://t.co/iajDTmvUbc" / Twitter

After more than a decade growing leaders as a VP of Engineering, Lara now specializes in supporting members of underrepresented groups.

Lara has found herself at capacity with coaching clients in early 2019. She has since grown the Wherewithall coaching team, so we can continue to support even more tech industry leaders!

## Decision Making

I enjoyed this interview on how to make better decisions.

My favorite part...

> "in the context of a group discussion, the consensus is uninteresting." 

So very true. Consensus is not useful in decision making. 

>I’m not saying that there’s no valuable information in there whatsoever, which is why you allow people to see the points of agreement and discuss them briefly at the beginning of a meeting. But in the context of a group discussion, the consensus is uninteresting.

If I want to make a good decision, I want to identify people I respect who are well-informed and yet have a completely different opinion than mine. And I want to spend time exploring that and understanding their point of view. I might be wrong, and if I’m wrong, I’ll benefit from having someone correct me. But even if I’m not wrong, I’m going to benefit by explaining my beliefs to others — the underlying rationale and evidence to support them.
