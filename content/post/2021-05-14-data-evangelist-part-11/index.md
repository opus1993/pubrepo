Our Chicago-area work team ventured back into the office this week for an important on-boarding meet and greet. We kicked it off by going around the table, one at a time, with the usual set of icebreaker questions:

-   *What's your name and your title?*
-   *What makes you tick? What drives you?*
-   *Why do you do the work that you do?*

I am amused that nobody said "the six-level delegation of signature authority for securing spending approvals" or "making Powerpoint slides that committees above my pay grade will tweak again and again."

My plan here is to explain why the digital mission runs counter to many corporate cultures and also throw in a handful of posts as seen on social media this week. On that theme, this brief post will cover:

-   Decision making,
-   Three book recommendations,
-   The value of data,
-   Upcoming events,
-   Iwao Fusillo, Chief Data and Analytics Officer and Data Evangelist at General Motors

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

## Decision Making

My favorite part of this interview:

*"...in the context of a group discussion, the consensus is uninteresting."*

To make a **good decision**, I want to identify people I respect who are well-informed and yet have a completely different perspective than mine. And I want to spend time understanding their point of view. I might be wrong, and if I'm wrong, I'll benefit from having someone correct me. But even if I'm not wrong, I'm going to benefit by explaining my thinking to others, along with the underlying rationale and evidence.

## How can leaders educate themselves on the value of data and the opportunity that it presents?

I doubt that business leaders in 2021 are working with a knowledge deficit on data. Some leader's goals, however, may not be aligned on the mission. [Tom Davenport](https://www.tomdavenport.com/about/) has been writing on the topic for many years. In 2019, for example:

> [More than a decade after the concept of big data became part of the lexicon, only a minority of companies have become insight-driven organizations...](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/analytics/insight-driven-organization.html)

When you think about it, analytics has been with us for centuries, though only in the last couple of decades has there been the widespread interest in driving serious, scaled utilization out to the front lines. For example, sophisticated maps have existed for a long time. Shared coverage maps between two combines working in real time in the same field is new. The value and the opportunity: velocity and the customer experience.

So, do we really fail to recognize the value? We have, within our reach, huge amounts of relatively easy-to-access data and algorithms invoked through user interfaces that guide even novice users to a reasonably accurate path. This is coupled with more than ample network connectivity/bandwidth, and compute cycles are, for all intents and purposes, infinite. So, why is it that we are not doing more, faster? 

Cassie Kozyrkov [boils it down](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-decision-makers-guide-to-starting-ai-72ee0d7044df) in the simplest possible terms to:

-   Figure out who's in charge
-   Identify the use case
-   Do some reality checks
-   Craft a performance metric wisely
-   Set testing criteria to overcome human biases

She notes that if the person in charge of the project doesn't understand the business, you may as well just light that cash on fire now. You'll just bolt on a system to make mistakes, faster.

In [Can the Capital Planning Process Ever be Fixed?](https://marckermisch.com/can-the-capital-planning-process-ever-be-fixed/), Mark Kermisch (CNH CIO) notes that a successful product owner must be disciplined in facilitating a rapid feedback loop from customers to the agile team. Agile's approach is to develop a minimum viable product, delivering the best value for the customer in the fastest possible time.

*Why do you do the work that you do?*

To accelerate the delivery velocity of meaningful customer experiences, solving problems for people by building architectures and enterprise competencies for diverse cross functional teams to do what they do at scale, faster. It's not six level DOA, nor is it Powerpoint.
