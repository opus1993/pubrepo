Beyond our immediate concerns about SARS-CoV-19 in 2020, there are changes that are fueling major shifts in the global economy and wider society. These changes, or megatrends, will be enormous in their impact.

Four megatrends include:

1. __Digitalization__

1. __Automation__

1. __Servitization__

1. __Alternative Propulsion__

All of the major heavy equipment companies have been working on strategic initiatives to navigate in the context of these megatrends, through internal projects, partnerships and acquisitions, new product launches and the presentation of innovative technology concepts.

__Digitalization__, the critical enabler for automation and autonomous vehicles, and __connectivity__, are both now obvious and expected by off highway customers globally. __Servitization__ will become increasingly important in creating new business models that will shake up aftermarket components and service business models. And the growing concern about climate change has underscored the importance of work on alternative propulsion systems and efforts to become carbon neutral.

## What then is Servitization?

Servitization refers to new business models that leverage legacy products to sell ‚Äúoutcome as a service‚Äù rather than a one-off sale. Netflix and Uber are some of the most well-known examples today. Consider that Neflix today delivers media on demand as a service, rather than customers buying the DVDs that produce those outcomes. 

The term servitization was first introduced in 1988 by Sandra Vandermerwe and Juan Rada, who argued that manufacturers needed a way to set themselves apart from competitors, and more importantly to retain their customer base and increase levels of differentiation. However, the concept of servitization can actually be traced back to the 1960s, to Bristol Siddeley aircraft engines providing ‚ÄúPower By The Hour.‚Äù It was a complete engine and accessory replacement service charged at a set fee per flying hour. Rather than buying the engine, the airline bought the power it provided, allowing operators greater forecasting accuracy and relieving them of the capital costs of carrying spare parts.

Servitization is often a subscription model, and given some thought can be applied to most industries in one way or another. Xerox and others in the office printer business have offered service agreements priced by the printed page to corporate clients for many years. 

Dr. Howard Lightfoot at the Operations Excellence Institute at Cranfield University, argues in his book [Made to Serve](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Made-Serve-Baines/dp/1118585313) that academics have been encouraging manufacturers to focus on the customer end of the supply chain for many decades.

Lightfoot proposes three levels of servitization;

**Product Provision** Most already do this and have been for some time. This is the basics of the manufacturing business, to build and sell. Once the machine leaves the factory, the product ceases to be a concern to the manufacturer, other than warranty commitments, but it also ceases to be a revenue stream.

**Aftersales Servicing**, repairs and condition monitoring. The maintenance of a product provides ongoing sources of revenue to both dealers and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Beyond repairs and maintenance components, they are also in the form of software updates, feature un-locks, and add-on kits made available through a local dealer network. Many machines with power units can be outfitted for other missions for a second or a third owner during its useful life.

**Advanced Services** Taking aftersales to the next level, advanced services are more relationship focused and customer-centric than just selling and maintaining a product. In many cases, advanced services are delivered on a subscription model in which the consumer pays for the outcome ‚Äì whether that be hours of jet propulsion or pages printed.

As product providers climb through this service hierarchy, they take on more responsibility and risk. 

> ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre offering an availability contract, and the customer is paying you on that basis, you have to ensure that you can deliver against that. What you get paid depends on what you provide. It‚Äôs not a case of ‚Äòyou sell the product, it breaks, and you fix it‚Äô ‚Äì those are the old days. You don‚Äôt see that in a modern servitized world.‚Äù - Dr. Howard Lightfoot

## IoT and Sensors

What makes for a successful servitization strategy? 

If manufacturers are to become service providers then it is their responsibility to keep the service up and running. Servitization is only a continuous and reliable revenue source for as long as the service is continuous and reliable. The Internet of Things and machine embedded sensors play a huge role. Sensors within equipment feed data back about the condition of parts and the overall product which should mean that maintenance issues can be resolved before the problem occurs. Or, should anything break unexpectedly, the manufacturer will be notified automatically.

As another example, John Deere bundles a precision farming package where participating customers and their supplying dealers record a tractor‚Äôs actual fuel consumption at the end of a one-year operating period. This is then compared to the target fuel consumption. This value depends on the average engine load and varies from light to heavy loads; every tractor model also has its own specific fuel target. If the total fuel consumption has exceeded John Deere‚Äôs target level, customers will be refunded by the company. The package also includes the initial basic set-up of the online monitoring portal, seasonal telephone support and other options.

In 2019, CNH Industrial acquired AgDNA, which forms a significant component of their long-term roadmap to extend their precision farming offering. AgDNA is a leading Farm Management Information System that automatically collects and analyzes data from heavy equipment. The cloud-based platform analyzes machine, agronomic and environmental data to deliver actionable insights directly to the producer‚Äôs smartphones and tablets to help them maximize the performance of CNH Industrial brands and other equipment to increase farm profitability.

> ‚ÄúIndustry boundaries are being redefined. You start with a truck, but it becomes a smart truck. Why? Because it‚Äôs been networked with CAN bus, which you can then use to collect data with a smart connection, typically cellular. This smart product can then be integrated into fleet management systems; so instead of being in the business of selling trucks, you‚Äôre moving towards providing fleet management.‚Äù - Dr. Howard Lightfoot

## Benefits

There are a number of benefits for adopting a servitization model, the first of which is fulfilling customers‚Äô demands, leading to greater customer retention. A business can no longer assume that the sales and financing of expensive assets alone will sustain a business. Customers are becoming more demanding with their requirements and additional services to meet those demands.

With a servitised business model, a customer pays only for the value it receives, while a manufacturer builds a profitable business from constant streams of additional, incremental revenue. What‚Äôs more, a manufacturer will gain useful insights into future R&D processes by analyzing the performance of a product sent to a customer and using this information to strive towards continuous product improvement.

## Risks 

When a business makes the decision to adopt a servitization model, there are specific channel management challenges, essentially because a service culture is different to a ‚Äòpush‚Äô through a dealership network culture. The design of services is different than the design of products, requiring a shift in the channel network mind-set to make the implementation successful.

A further challenge for businesses implementing a servitization model is the uncertainty of profitability. The key warning to heed here is that servitization takes time to develop. Channel management and product management are both critical for execution with complex portfolios.
