The [Chicago INFORMS Chapter](https://connect.informs.org/chicago/about-us/chicago-chapter) will be hosting a virtual **Resume Review** in late May this year. We're planning to invite students from chapters at Notre Dame, Northwestern, University of Chicago, NIU, DePaul and a couple other area schools to talk about select companies in the region that hire Data Science and Analytics professionals and coordinate quick "speed dating" type engagements with Talent Acquisition professionals for feedback.

Our world is changing so quickly. It's accelerating, even, as we emerge from COVID. The way education is delivered is also becoming more collaborative, and simultaneously more virtual. This brief post will cover a few thoughts on

-   the INFORMS Chicago Chapter,
-   Google Maps' Moat,
-   a Portfolio,
-   Upcoming Events,
-   Learning Data Science,
-   and a book recommendation.

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

## About the INFORMS Chicago Chapter

[INFORMS](https://connect.informs.org/chicago/about-us/chicago-chapter) serves the scientific and professional needs of Analytics Professionals and Operations Researchers including educators, scientists, students, managers, analysts, and consultants. The Institute serves as a focal point for analytics and O.R. professionals, with forums to communicate with each other and to reach out to other professional societies.

On the surface, the benefit of participating in local chapter events is visibility to the next generation of talent along with a bit of company promotion in the Chicago region. There are big shifts in power dynamics underway in the economy here. Some are obvious, like the marketplaces for mortgages and health insurance. Others, like autonomy in agriculture, are not so widely known yet. Somewhat selfishly, I want to know what it is that is compelling about the best of the best, both at businesses and the schools.

## Google Maps' Moat is Evaporating

Joe Morrison has published a number of great substack articles in recent months. [Here](https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/google-maps-moat-is-evaporating), he makes a compelling argument that *OpenStreetMap (OSM), over the next decade, has the potential to do to Google what Android did to Apple: dramatically grow the overall market while drawing a clear line between the larger “open” ecosystem and the smaller “proprietary” one.* Joe doesn't believe Google can maintain its current leading position in the  mapping world for another decade without pivoting to embrace the same open ecosystem that FAAMm (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Mapbox) is using to challenge them.

The lazy way to tell the history of computing is by enumerating key events. There’s a different framing that’s more compelling: the history of computing can be told from the point of view of shifting power. Will Google maps fall as the next victim?

The geospatial world is far more than just Google's killer mobile phone app. [This](https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/4M2qsfRzxQEPrWnCRpwfRR) 42 minute podcast explores the ways that access to geospatial data has a dramatic impact on local economies, and how open source GIS professionals make room for unexpected contributors, and the philosophical mindset to support unrestricted access to accelerate collaborative innovation.

When I look at business topics like heavy equipment supply chains, precision agriculture, capital risk management, and even sustainability, I can't help but think of the power shifts already underway for the market participants with open data resources and machine learning.

## A Portfolio

As a general rule, business and industrial engineering programs at universities have impressed upon students the need to build portfolios because in the interview it shows distinctive real-world experiences, and is an opportunity to explain to an employer where candidate skills align with the data science workflow to deliver value. Ultimately, the hiring manager's decision is made on the value potential of each candidate.

Students assemble documentation on a capstone or internship experience and post it to a blog or github to showcase the work. Some will also prepare a business case presentation and video content. Interviews for junior analytics roles should have some context for how what the candidate brings fits with what the enterprise workflow requires.

[Not every data scientist does "data science" work](https://towardsdatascience.com/heres-the-honest-truth-about-making-a-career-switch-into-data-science-2e5a42d24879). The range of skills and job responsibilities at one company can look completely different at another. There really are very few organizations with the specialization where a single person only builds machine learning models.

Matt Dancho writes here in more detail on team building and skills alignment in the enterprise:

## Learning Data Science

Way back in the February [Data Evangelist post](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/2021-02-05-data-evangelist-part-2/), I mused on some of the high points of my own learning journey and mentioned a link to a recent Linda Burtch talk. I’ve seen “business intelligence analyst” postings that require NLP and Python. I've seen
"Analytics-Data Scientist Manager" that require SAS, R, and Python.

This question still lingers in my mind:

> For your own company, do you know what the material is on the technical evaluation for new Data Science and Analytics hires?

Vin Vashishta has been researching the most recent changes in Data Science job requirements amoung his clients and talks about his findings in the embedded video. Most of the standard curriculum out there is 4+ years old, as there is a lag in academic feedback loops. Even so, for leading edge companies the technical stack core components are still relatively stable, with the same programming languages, libraries, and packages. Vin cites some notable changes on the perimeter, as more advanced technical needs, including:

- JavaScript frameworks (i.e. R Shiny and other),
- Git versioning (and Continuous Integration),
- Google Cloud Platform, (S3, and Azure Storage),
- Docker and Containers,
- Pipelines and best practices for data gathering,
- and MLOps.

For 2021, the job requirements for data scientists that have changed __the most__ include:

- **Business Communications**:  As Dancho and Burtch note above, Data Scientists must demonstrate that they are capable of creating business value. Most job postings have multiple lines where employers spell out what is expected in terms of stakeholder engagement and active communications, finding opportunities through teamwork and collaboration. These also include proactive thought leadership, coalition building, and mentoring to drive enterprise growth.

- **Software Engineering Robustness**:  The drive towards production delivery means that having a background in the processes of crafting reliable and maintainable code is increasingly important. This means writing unit tests and supporting continuous integration to work at scale with software developers. 

- **Managed Innovation**: Experimental processes must be statistically sound to assure the business that the model has "learned" something useful. Causal inference is becoming more and more important in research planning and exploring feasibility, especially in business settings, where the artifacts need to be available for re-use across all functional groups to deliver competitive advantage. Demonstrate where off-the-shelf models can be customized to exploit novel approaches to achieve results not available at any competitor.

- **Data Management**: Data scientists today are expected to take a more active role in  data acquisition and infrastructure, to be accountable for the curation of useful features into a feature store. This may require being responsible for finding high-quality third party data resources to enhance models for competitive advantage. [For example](https://r-spatial.org/r/2021/04/23/cloud-based-cubes.html), in geospatial domains, be prepared to talk about successes with curating unique geospatial datasets like satellite imagery.

- **Active Learning and Teaching**:  As a technical mentor, rapidly learn and then mentor others in the enterprise. Identify areas for knowledge growth relevant to the business and to the team. Where appropriate, be prepared to share with partners outside of the business as well. Guest lecturing at a nearby university, mentoring capstone projects, or working events with a local INFORMS chapter creates a number of follow-on benefits for the company.

## Book Recommendation

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050QB3EQ/"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41IhorJP5UL.jpg" alt="The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, &amp; Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy" width="400"/></a>

Bayes' rule appears to be a straightforward, one-line theorem: by updating our initial beliefs with objective new information, we get a new and improved belief. To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about learning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok. In this very readable book for general audiences, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores this simple theorem and the generations-long human drama surrounding it.
