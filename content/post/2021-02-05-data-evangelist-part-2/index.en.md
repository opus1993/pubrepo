Comedian Jerry Seinfeld's new autobiography opens with a reflection of his formative years, discovering the thrill of connecting with a live audience, arriving at standup comedy as his calling. ‚Äú[Is This Anything?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084BYK62K/)‚Äù is a decade-by-decade collection of ideas he initially wrote out on yellow legal pads, then honed in front of audiences, until a select few of them became his act. The book covers the evolution of the comedian and provides insights into the unforgiving art of writing for an audience.

Landing the connection with the audience is a core tenet of business school programs, with didactic multi-step methodologies to make anyone a professional. For example, **#3** smile, **#6** walk towards your audience, and **#8** tell a story. Yet, outside of the bleeding edge of social media, meaningful connections with audiences is still lacking, and the data science domain is no exception.

The cover image is a woodblock printing entitled "[Tokugawa Iemitsu Receiving Lords in Audience](https://artvee.com/dl/tokugawa-iemitsu-receiving-lords-in-audience)" The artist, Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, like many Japanese of that era, was interested in new things from the rest of the world, but over time he became increasingly concerned with the loss of aspects of traditional Japanese culture that brought people together.

In Amanda Mull's Atlantic piece "[The Pandemic Has Erased Entire Categories of Friendship](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/pandemic-goodbye-casual-friends/617839/)," she explains how there‚Äôs a reason you miss the people you didn‚Äôt even know that well. Most people are familiar with the idea of an inner circle. Sociologists propose that we also have an outer circle, vital to our social health in its own ways.

Ughhhhhh someone copy-pasted the entire source of two of my #rstats packages and then rebadged as a new package 'inspired' by one of mine. Yes this is permitted by the MIT license, but copying code and passing it off as your own is intellectual fraud.
