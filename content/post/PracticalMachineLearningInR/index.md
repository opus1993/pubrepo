Machine learning and data analytics have emerged as critical value creation tools. One measure of this is the huge array of titles now available in bookstores. Machine learning reveals patterns from data, bringing insight to organizations, allowing leaders to incorporate predictive tools into their decision-making processes. Because machine learning spans several knowledge domains, the best-selling books fall into a couple of categories. 

The first category of books are focused on helping businesses move quickly to capture competitive advantage by leveraging information technology and upskilling teams. The world is changing rapidly in all fields, from education, to marketing, to providing services like health care. We all have a stake in defining AI ethics, security expectations, and even how best to deploy the tools. Among the books in this category, be sure to read Foster Provost & Tom Fawcett's [Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking](http://data-science-for-biz.com/) 

A second category of books are technical guides written by academics and software providers. Many of these are very good. See Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for an example.

As a bridge between these two categories, professors [Fred Nwanganga](https://twitter.com/gangafred) and [Mike Chapple](https://twitter.com/mchapple) have written an approachable, hands-on book, [Practical Machine Learning in R](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Practical+Machine+Learning+in+R-p-9781119591535), to provide readers with the knowledge to harness the power of machine learning algorithms along with timely business context to explain what machine learning is, demonstrate its benefits, and provide examples in the R programming language.

### Contents

Unlike other books, *Practical Machine Learning in R* covers both a conceptual and a technical introduction to machine learning. In 12 Chapters, the reader will

> Explore data management techniques, including data collection, exploration and feature selection

> Describe the principles behind Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classification techniques

> Explain how to evaluate models, as well as improving model performance using ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost

> Briefly cover unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns using approaches such as apriori, eclat and clustering

### Why not AutoML?

Business savvy readers might ask where drag and drop Graphical User Interface AutoML (Automatic Machine Learning) tools fit, and why invest time in R?

One cannot introduce AutoML without mentioning the machine learning projectâ€™s life cycle, which includes data preparation, feature selection, model selection, parameter optimization, model validation, and communication. As advanced as technology has become, data science projects still remain time-consuming and repetitive.

Though AutoMLs can be efficient at building models from prepared datasets, they are still not capable of performing the time consuming parts. We still need analysts and data scientists to engage the business. We still need engineers to apply domain knowledge to generate useful features. At it's best, AutoML still can only deal with limited types of problems. Most importantly, we still need data scientists to draw actionable insights from the data.

### What's missing?

Readers should look elsewhere for detailed instruction on crucial skills in statistics, SQL, data visualization, and computing architectures. Time series forecasting and geospatial topics warrant their own books as well. The new [`glmnet`](https://glmnet.stanford.edu/articles/glmnet.html) methodology offers another robust technique for fitting a generalized linear model, and offers solutions to overfitting and p-hacking that often plague stepwise regression in practice.

*Practical Machine Learning in R* demonstrates machine learning using R libraries that are mature, stable, and widely available, including the `tidyverse` and a little bit of `caret`. In the near future, the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and [`mlr3`](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/) packages in development will likely eventually emerge as the professional tools of choice.

Data science is evolving so quickly that a second edition is likely in the works already.

### Conclusion

*Practical Machine Learning in R* is a useful guide for aspiring business analysts, data scientists, and other professionals interested in leveraging the power of Machine Learning to solve business problems. The publisher makes [code examples and exercise solutions](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Practical+Machine+Learning+in+R-p-9781119591535) available. Independent learners will appreciate the approach that the authors have taken to provide a foundation in teaching Machine Learning.
