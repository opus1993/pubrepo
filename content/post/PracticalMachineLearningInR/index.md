First, a disclosure. I know the authors of [Practical Machine Learning in R](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Practical+Machine+Learning+in+R-p-9781119591535), as both professors [Fred Nwanganga](https://twitter.com/gangafred) and [Mike Chapple](https://twitter.com/mchapple) teach courses in the Notre Dame Mendoza MSBA program. It is a rare pleasure to be able to read a book and to hear the actual author's voice in the words. After finishing the MSBA program, I felt obligated to take this book up and explore the topics again. 

Over the last few years, machine learning has become the hot topic as a critical value creation tool. Executive leadership expects that robust data driven predictive tools be brought into their decision-making processes. Because machine learning spans several knowledge domains, best-selling books fall into a couple of categories. 

The first category are business books, focused on helping people by leveraging information technology. The world is changing rapidly in all fields. We all have a stake in defining AI ethics, security expectations, and even how best to deploy the tools. Among the books in this category, be sure to read Foster Provost & Tom Fawcett's [Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking](http://data-science-for-biz.com/) 

A second category of books are the technical guides written by academics and software providers. Many of these are also very good. See Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for an example.

As a bridge between these two categories, this book is billed as approachable and  hands-on, meant to provide readers with the knowledge to harness algorithms along with business context. All of the code examples are presented in the R language. R is popular because it is free and easy to start working with. R's open-source community spans academia and industry, with thousands of mature open-source add-on packages available.

### What's missing from **Practical Machine Learning in R**?

Readers should look elsewhere for detailed instruction on crucial skills in statistics, SQL, data visualization, and computing architectures. Time series forecasting and geospatial topics warrant their own books as well. The new [`glmnet`](https://glmnet.stanford.edu/articles/glmnet.html) methodology offers another robust technique for fitting a generalized linear model, and offers solutions to overfitting and p-hacking that can plague stepwise regression.

*Practical Machine Learning in R* demonstrates introductory machine learning using R libraries that are mature, stable, and widely available, including the `tidyverse` and a little bit of `caret`. In the near future, the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and [`mlr3`](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/) packages in development will likely eventually emerge as the professional tools of choice.

### My Conclusion

*Practical Machine Learning in R* is a useful guide for aspiring business analysts. The publisher makes [code examples and exercise solutions](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Practical+Machine+Learning+in+R-p-9781119591535) available. Independent learners will appreciate the approach that the authors have taken in carefully explaining every step. The book only just scratches the surface of what is available in the R ecosystem. In a learning journey with analytics, [Practical Machine Learning in R](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Practical+Machine+Learning+in+R-p-9781119591535) sets a high standard for a solid, foundational instructional text.
