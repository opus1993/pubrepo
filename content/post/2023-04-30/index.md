This is a big week for pruning my identity down to the details that are relevant to finding my way forward. Wiping the old company cell phone (and 2FA) and dropping the e-mail are just the beginning. I will need to find ways to focus on what matters, to simplify.  Right now, they include

1. Resume
1. Portfolio
1. Skills
1. Applications

The [Eisenhower Matrix](https://luxafor.com/the-eisenhower-matrix/) could come in handy in sorting through the noise.

## Networking

1. With the pre-arranged guest host out, the [Posit Data Science Leader's Hangout](https://posit.co/data-science-hangout/) was improvised a bit last week. [Alan Schussman](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7057887863966756864-Gbfn) called it **Chaos Mode**. The regulars in this group really stepped up.  This little group is so passionate about learning, exploring diverse perspectives, and raising the bar for what it means to be part of this profession.

1. My last couple of peer phone calls have not been particularly productive. The [Weak Ties](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/09/15/real-strength-weak-ties/) research suggests that I cast a wider net and reach out further.  Having worked in a large corporate context for so many years, I am curious about work and life at places that aren't large or corporate.

## What I'm reading this week:

### The Big Myth

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bloomsbury-atlas/image/upload/w_568,c_scale/jackets/9781635573572.jpg" width="25%"/>

Former President Herbert Hoover is a key figure of Chapter 3, "Fighting the New Deal," along with the John Raskob's American Liberty League. Their efforts could be characterized as political propaganda that framed government collectivism as undesirable, like communism, and private corporate property and profit motive as equivalent to freedom.  The authors rightly note that 1) the Great Depression itself was a failure of unfettered private enterprise and 2) corporate entities are also very much collective projects.

I am looking forward to diving into the chapters on Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics, the libertarian roots of Little House on the Prairie, and the GE sponsored efforts to beam free-market doctrine to every American household.

### Cuttlefish

John Cutler [writes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnpcutler_not-all-a-players-wear-capes-in-fact-activity-7058477712385970176-u8qj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

> Not all "A players" wear capes.

> In fact...many of the most talented people i know are pretty low key, and would be very hesitant to ever label themselves as an "A player".

> Not all "A players" will get in your face and fetishize "grit."

> They don't attach too much of their identity to work, draw boundaries, and have a life outside work. They are patient with their career and play the long game.

> When things aren't going well at work, they are more capable of detaching a bit and seeing it for the Shakespearean comedy that it is. They understand that, in most cases, attempts to force change will backfire.

> Give them a challenging problem to solve surrounded by a healthy environment, and they will succeed. Put them in an incoherent, unsafe environment and they will draw the line.

> Leaders often think they need to motivate these employees when they need to stop de-motivating them. They get frustrated dealing with these team members because, on some level, it exposes their own issues with work/life boundaries and their emotional connection with work.

> "How dare my team have these boundaries I cannot maintain?"

> "Well, I guess if you don't care much about your job, that is fine".

> "They aren't committed! They have no sense of ownership! They aren't ambitious!"

> No! They (these talented folks) lack the desire to share their ambition and sense of ownership with an environment that will not reciprocate. They are ambitious on their terms! They have a healthy level of commitment! They realize that their company isn't going to return the favor necessarily.

> So the lesson for leaders is clear.
>> 1. Be self-aware. Not everyone is wired like you are wired
>> 2. Don't read a book by its cover
>> 3. Seek to understand what makes people tick
>> 4. Instead of trying to change people, create an environment where their natural traits can shine.

## Recruiters
Outplacement advisory will pick up in a couple of weeks. Let's keep this section as a placeholder.  I'm keen on hearing what the experts have to say about the marketplace and what works.

## Referrals

Some of the volunteers that I had worked with over the years in our local Scouting program have stepped up for me in answering job posting inquiries, simply from sending a ping via SMS text or LinkedIn message.
