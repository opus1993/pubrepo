<p>R 4.0.0 is expected to be released to CRAN on Friday April 24th</p>
<p>At that time, all packages will need to be (re-)installed.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a short script to keep a list of your current R packages and how to reinstall them after updating:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Before the update, save current packages and their versions to ip
ip &lt;- installed.packages()
ip

saveRDS(ip, &quot;~/CurrentPackages.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># After updating base R, load the file in reverse

ip &lt;- readRDS(&quot;~/CurrentPackages.rds&quot;)
 
install.packages(ip[,1])</code></pre>

<p>On my windows system, I am going to start fresh. It will be interesting to come back in a month to compare what I need with what I had previously.</p>
