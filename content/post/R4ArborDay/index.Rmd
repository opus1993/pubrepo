R 4.0.0 is expected to be released to CRAN on Friday April 24th

At that time, all packages will need to be (re-)installed.

Here's a short script to keep a list of your current R packages and how to reinstall them after updating:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Before the update, save current packages and their versions to ip
ip <- installed.packages()
ip

saveRDS(ip, "~/CurrentPackages.rds")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# After updating base R, load the file in reverse

ip <- readRDS("~/CurrentPackages.rds")
 
install.packages(ip[,1])

```

On my windows system, I am going to start fresh. It will be interesting to come back in a month to compare what I need with what I had previously.
