My short list of useful books, courses, tutorials, and expert blogs. Most are free. These could be departure points for your own learning journey. My hope is that you take and copy sections for sharing with your own community of practice. 

Yes, I am giving away all of the secrets. One of the things that I spend a lot of time thinking about in my work is how to communicate about data science with other human beings. It is often too easy to focus on “just” the technical skills like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data. Describing, documenting, planning, collaborating, questioning, and communicating effectively is harder than it sounds. When our team members each have a baseline of competencies, we work better together on the problems we face.

Tell me about what is good here, and what I have missed.

## Introductory Books
**R for Data Science** and the **R Cookbook** were our primary resources in the Notre Dame Business Analytics program. 

|     |    | 
|:---|:---:|
|**[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)** by [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) and [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/StatGarrett) is an excellent introduction to the Tidyverse. The [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) hosts book club-style weekly chapter discussions through their Slack channels. [Vebash Naidoo](https://twitter.com/sciencificity) has assembled a related [solutions guide supplement](https://sciencificity.github.io/R4DS_study_exams/index.html).|<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><img alt="R for Data Science" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b88ef926a004b0fce72b2526b0b5c4413666a4cb/24a30/cover.png" width="250"></a>|
|**[R Cookbook](https://rc2e.com/)** by [JD Long](https://twitter.com/CMastication), [Paul Teetor](https://twitter.com/pteetor) and [R-Cookbook](https://twitter.com/R_cookbook) is full of how-to recipes, each of which solves a specific problem. The recipe includes a quick introduction followed by a discussion that unpacks the solution and provides insight into how it works.|<a href="https://rc2e.com/"><img alt="R Cookbook, 2nd Edition" src="https://rc2e.com/images_v2/book_cover.jpg" width="250"></a>|

## Empirical Bayes
In this little book, David Robinson introduces powerful tools for handling uncertainty across observations. It teaches both the math behind these and the code that you can adapt to your own data through the detail of a single case study: batting averages in baseball. He wrote it for people (like me) who need to understand and apply methods, but would rather work with real data than face down pages of equations.

So why is Empirical Bayes worth learning? Frankly, this method is especially well suited for the modern application of data science.

## Machine Learning
Mastery of the wide array of Machine Learning techniques for prediction and inference in real business contexts requires a broad and deep study. Long-time engineers like me often make the mistake of skipping ahead to the Kaggle award winning algorithms and the CV buzzwords. We're smart. Just wing it, right? *This is a bad idea.*

There is a running joke on Twitter that most resumes that list Natural Language Processing as a skill are *at-best* suggesting an awareness of regular expressions.  To be blunt, the free materials available at this point are not sufficient to provide a proper foundation in the many risks and trade-offs, particularly with respect to each knowledge domain. For example, consider SARs COVID-19 and all of the epidemiological models and ramifications for policy decisions. Further, the leading edge of thinking in many ML areas is changing rapidly.

Though none of these are free, find each of these at a library or a gently used copy, as students use them in classes and often sell them back.

Find other materials on AI ethics in your specific working domain and be prepared to consider the impacts of validating and generalizing your work. No computing tool does this for you by itself, even if it claims to be automatic.

Machine learning modeling frameworks do offer somewhat more streamlined solutions for pre-processing, scoring, and publishing models. The most popular is arguably [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) over in the Python world. There are also fully supported proprietary systems available from SAS and Mathworks, at a cost. The most popular deep learning neural-net frameworks at this point in time are Tensorflow and Torch, with interfaces from many programming languages.

## Meetups, Blogs, and User Groups
A seasoned [useR group](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) organizer reminded me recently that a non-trivial amount of effort is required to organize meetups, find speakers, get locations (non-covid times), market the meetups, etc. One way we all can help is to volunteer to speak, volunteer a location, help market, farm for speakers, etc. There is a moral motivation in the [open source](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/open-source/) R community to lift one another up and recognize efforts. The software is "free" as in speech, not as in beer. If you learn something useful and encounter a [buy me coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) button, be sure to offer  a cup of java in return.
