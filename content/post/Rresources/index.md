My short list of useful free books, courses, tutorials, and expert blogs. These are all possible departure points for your own learning journey. Where possible, look for materials that integrate your subject area of interest. 

## Introductory Books
**R for Data Science** and the **R Cookbook** were primary resources, at least for me, in the Notre Dame Business Analytics program. 
- **[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)** and [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/StatGarrett) is excellent. The [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) hosts book club-style weekly chapter reviews through Slack channels, and [Vebash](https://twitter.com/sciencificity) has assembled a nice [solutions guide supplement](https://sciencificity.github.io/R4DS_study_exams/index.html).

## Machine Learning
Mastery of the wide array of Machine Learning techniques for prediction and inference in real business contexts requires a broad and deep study. Long-time engineers like me often make the mistake of skipping ahead to the Kaggle award winning algorithms and the CV buzzwords. We're smart. Just wing it, right? A bad idea. 

There is a running joke on Twitter that most resumes that list Natural Language Processing as a skill are *at-best* indicating the use of regular expressions.  To be blunt, the free materials available at this point are not sufficient to provide a proper foundation in the many risks and trade-offs, particularly with respect to each knowledge domain. For example, consider SARs COVID-19 and all of the epidemiological models and ramifications for policy decisions. Further, the leading edge of thinking in many ML areas is changing rapidly.

Though it is not free, find a copy of Provost and Fawcett's **Data Science for Business** published by O'Reilly. Nwanganga and Chapple's **Practical Machine Learning in R** [reviewed here](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/practical-machine-learning-in-r/) is another approachable book. Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari's **Regression and Other Stories, Analytical Methods for Social Research** is an applied statistics text that provides real-world lessons for quantitative researchers applying ML techniques. Find other materials on AI ethics in your specific working domain and be prepared to consider the impacts of validating and generalizing your work. No computing tool does this for you by itself, even if it claims to be automatic.

Machine learning modeling frameworks do offer somewhat more streamlined solutions for pre-processing, scoring, and publishing models. The most popular is arguably [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) over in the Python world. There are also fully supported proprietary systems available from SAS and Mathworks, at a cost. The most popular deep learning neural-net frameworks at this point in time are Tensorflow and Torch, with interfaces from many programming languages.

For a free glimpse into the R environment ML frameworks, consider these resources:
