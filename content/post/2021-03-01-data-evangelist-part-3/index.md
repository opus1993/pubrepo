The fields of Artificial Intelligence are touted by futurists as the answers to many of the world's problems. And AI skeptics in turn write on topics like ethics & privacy because they resonate with the widest possible audience, driving readership.

This post is a different sort of AI critique. What we call our roles and our work matters. Vin Vashishta, chief data scientist and author, recently called out [**digital transformation**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-transformation-strategy-barrier-data-science-vin-vashishta/) as it mislabels many things as AI, and as such creates barriers to realizing value from the technology. The result is expensive analytics with the Artificial Intelligence label slapped on. Follow Vin over on LinkedIN. I will also comment in this post on 

- the [Wil van der Aalst Process Mining course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining), 
- creating sustainable competitive advantage,  
- two of the change management questions from [last week](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/2021-02-05-data-evangelist-part-2/),
- a look at how Microsoft manages AI initiatives,
- and close with two book recommendations. 

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Arthur C. Clarke

I've had the good fortune to have reached two decades with the same company through mergers and a wide variety of roles. The past three years have been unusual in the way we have had to unlearn and dismantle groups to be competitive. The wave of underperforming pilot projects is a direct result of legacy structures struggling to adapt. **Digital transformation** may be the right sentiment, but a 20-year-old business strategy cannot build the foundation for achieving it.

Specifically, **digital transformation** as it is understood by some business stakeholders does not facilitate adopting the culture required for AI. **Digital transformation** is software automation centric. It is the promise of easy BI with the governance of "no." There is no innovation or competitive advantage created. As such, it is a control room task list rather than a strategy.

Vashishta argues that **Digital transformation** as we know it today is unnecessary, creating barriers on the path to modernizing entire business models. In contrast, startups not burdened by legacy systems unleash talent and deliver customer value far more quickly and effectively. Abandoning **digital transformation** is more efficient than inserting it into existing departments. We need to talk about how.

The first step of strategic planning in any context is full lifecycle **research**. Embracing an AI strategy is no different. **Research** results in artifacts the business uses to inform strategic planning. Once a supported strategy has been built, each subsequent iteration builds competitive advantage. Unique models create a high wall because they are difficult for competitors to reproduce.

Consider for a moment how budgets and cost savings are valued. **Digital transformation** fights for its share of budget allocation within business units for automating reporting and dashboards, with barely credible justifications. In many cases there is little relationship between project metrics and business metrics. **Research**, on the other hand, is essential to driving the core strategic portfolio of products and services that the business offers.

In [BI and Data Science: The Best of Both Worlds](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/03/04/bi-and-ds-part1/), Lou Bajuk writes that "*These common purposes and capabilities, ironically, often trap the teams that use and maintain these tools as organizational competitors for software budgets and executive mindshare. These very different approaches can end up delivering applications and dashboards that may (at first glance) appear very similar. The strengths, weaknesses and nuances of the two approaches can be obscured to decision makers, especially to executive budget holders.*"

## From Opinion Driven to Research Driven

Even in 2021, organizations are riddled with opinions in search of supporting data. Connections between strategy and outcomes are proven after the fact. There may be data involved but not rigor. 

A **research** process gathers data, declares a hypothesis, builds a model, iterates and experiments to understand the business systems being modeled, and only then releases a thesis supported by evidence gathered during experiments. The strategy planning process then is a peer review of the thesis by senior leadership. A research process creates tangible, reliable results with rigor.

According to Vashishta, **Digital transformation** stops short at the hypothesis step. In many cases the data are not available within the decision timeframe, so the organization falls back on expert testimony, or "priors." In a rapidly changing competitive environment, priors alone should not be used to predict or to prescribe. There has been little validation to support their use. The result is overly expensive analytics with the AI label slapped on.

## Research for Sustainable Competitive Advantage

Machine Learning's advantage is in its ability to build models that simulate customer experiences, business processes, and even entire marketplaces. Done well, **research** happens rapidly based upon iterative data gathering and experimentation. Poor assumptions are discarded early. Experiments are designed to prove the model provides valuable inferences and predictions.

AI teams expect to be challenged. They expect review, critiques, and skepticism and are accustomed to it. It is their job to craft experiments and to prove or refute a hypothesis. To be robust, the work is also a managed process with deliverables. The research agenda includes artifacts and publications. In contrast, the **digital transformation** agenda is to perpetuate itself.

Consider an industry like FinTech. The reason hedge funds are willing to pay Machine Learning Engineers' extraordinary salaries is driven by their unique understanding of business performance characteristics, an advantage valued in the billions of dollars.

## Removing Barriers 

Kenny Ning's [blog post](https://kleandata.substack.com/p/data-science-is-different) on his poor experiences as a new hire tell an all-too-common story. His employer's job description read “Data Scientist” with requirements of “Master’s degree or higher; experience in deep learning frameworks a plus.” But that was not the content of the job.

In the end, Kenny was more than glad to get out and find a company where management was actually competent enough to articulate what they were looking for. Ironically, the best tools are largely open source. Much of the talent is already out there, and even upskilling can be relatively inexpensive when compared to employee churn. If company governance blocks access to data and tools, there is little benefit to be gained from hiring people with data science & AI skills.

## An example at Microsoft

Microsoft's own machine learning community is a global network that strives to 

<p style="text-align: center;">"break the hierarchy"</p>

Their principles include creating opportunities for people to contribute by organizing a variety of events like tutorials, panels, and Ask Me Anything Sessions. 

People development at Microsoft has a dedicated budget and a community manager. Microsoft allocates compute resources and licenses to ensure that knowledge building and learning continues. There is always a forum to communicate with one another, build sufficient consensus, and secure support from leadership.

Real change requires frequent communication and widespread awareness. The recognition of the role that AI and Data Science services play within the company is critical, as well as enabling the supporting resources.

Drew Conway’s famous [Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) on what data science is made of stresses the importance of substantive expertise as an integral part of data science. Fostering a culture of collaboration between business and data science functions ensures it. On the other hand, an argument can also be made for the inverse. Ensuring that the business has enough knowledge of data science to be able to accurately reflect and act on the findings of data-driven insights is just as important. Without this, insights discovered by the data science community will not be able to have the fullest possible impact on the business, or, at worst, could even end up being misinterpreted. 

In the last Data Evangelist post I posed several [change management and leadership questions](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/2021-02-05-data-evangelist-part-2/). The first two:

- Where exactly is our center of excellence for analytics?

- Where is the analytics leadership forum, and how are they delivering to the business?

Following the Microsoft example, the answer is **a distributed center of excellence on Artificial Intelligence**.

The main goal of the center: 
> Create value for our customers through a global expert network of small teams on multiple sites. Each team is to have core expertise on specific use cases.

The network itself focuses on:
> Long term strategic vision, with a technology roadmap

> Sharing of knowledge

> Finding solutions for common challenges

> Pooling & commonizing toolchains and technologies

What it is not:
> A passive monthly standing meeting

Leadership then fosters active collaboration, sharing, and skills progression across the enterprise. This requires travel and freeing up cohorts to dedicate time to workshops to stimulate exchanges across the network.

## [Process Mining: Data science in Action](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining) 

Coursera offers [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining) by [Wil van der Aalst](https://www.acm.org/articles/people-of-acm/2021/wil-van-der-aalst) at Eindhoven University of Technology as 14 hours of videos, supplementary reading, case studies, quizzes, and an available certificate. The textbook is a nice deskside reference, but not necessary.

There are many business contexts where logged event data is available for research of process sequences. Consider, for example, dealer repair processes and optimizing time to fix. Process mining techniques provide the analyst with tools to model the process visually, explore bottlenecks, and describe conformity. The course provides a cursory link to a handful of machine learning techniques for extending the practice to other domains.

The Business Process Management (BPM) discipline was considered to be dead a few years ago, but is thriving today with advances in process mining and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). RPA makes it possible to automate repetitive tasks cost-effectively. Process mining supports RPA initiatives by uncovering opportunities. The process mining discipline connects process management and data science, and will continue to grow.

Paid versions of the software is available, though where needed I will be using excellent open source tools.

Ken Jee's recent short video post "Why I QUIT Data Science" speaks to the role and where it fits into the organization. It's nice that Ken shares his personal journey in a candid way.
