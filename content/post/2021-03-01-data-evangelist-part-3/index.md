The fields of Artificial Intelligence are touted by futurists and shamans as the answer to many of the world's problems. And AI skeptics often write on topics like ethics & privacy because they resonate with the widest possible audience, driving readership.

This post is a different sort of AI critique. What we call our roles and our work matters. Vin Vashishta recently called out [**digital transformation**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-transformation-strategy-barrier-data-science-vin-vashishta/) as it mislabels many things as Data Science, and as such creates barriers to realizing value from the technology. The result is expensive Analytics with the Artificial Intelligence label slapped on. I will also comment on the [Wil van der Aalst Process Mining course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining) and close with four book recommendations. Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Arthur C. Clarke

I've had the good fortune to have reached 25 years with the same company through mergers and a wide variety of roles. The past three years have been unusual in the way we have had to unlearn and dismantle organizations to be competitive. The wave of underperforming Data Science pilot projects is a direct result of legacy structures struggling to adapt. **Digital transformation** may be the right sentiment, but a 20-year-old business strategy cannot build the foundation for achieving it.

Specifically, **digital transformation** as it is understood by the business stakeholders and IT does not facilitate adopting the culture of Data Science and Machine Learning for AI. **Digital transformation** is software automation centric. It is the promise of easy BI with the governance of "no." There is no innovation or competitive advantage created. As such, it is a control room task list rather than a strategy.

**Digital transformation** as we know it today is unnecessary, creating barriers on the path to modernizing the entire business model. In it, IT builds magnificent walls and moats, and organizational units each develop their own knowledge islands. In contrast, startups not burdened by legacy systems unleash talent and deliver customer value far more quickly and effectively. Abandoning **digital transformation** is more efficient than inserting it into existing departments. We need to talk about how.

The first step of strategic planning in any context is full lifecycle **research**. Embracing a Data Science and Machine Learning strategy is no different. **Research** results in artifacts the business uses to inform strategic planning. Once a supported strategy has been built, each subsequent  iteration builds competitive advantage. Unique data sets and models create a high wall because they are difficult for competitors to reproduce.

Consider for a moment how budgets and cost savings are valued. **Digital transformation** fights for its share of budget allocation within business units for automating reporting and dashboards, with barely credible justifications. In many cases there is little support between project metrics and business metrics. **Research**, on the other hand, is essential to driving the core strategic portfolio of products and services that the business offers.

## From Opinion Driven to Research Driven

Even in 2021, organizations are riddled with opinions in search of supporting data. Connections between strategy and outcomes are proven after the fact. There may be data involved but not rigor. 

A **research** process gathers data, declares a hypothesis, builds a model, iterates and experiments to understand the business systems being modeled, and only then releases a thesis supported by evidence gathered during experiments. The strategy planning process then is a peer review of the thesis by senior leadership. A research process creates tangible, reliable results with rigor.

**Digital transformation** stops at the hypothesis step. In many cases the data are not available within the decision timeframe, so the organization falls back on expert testimony, or "priors." The result is an analytical conceptualization that is their best attempt to explain what has happened in the past.

In a rapidly changing competitive environment, priors alone should not be used to predict or to prescribe. There has been no validation or peer review to support their use. From a strategy planning and forward-looking perspective, analytics alone are not useful and are at-best hit or miss, particularly when looking 3+ years into the future.

**Digital transformation** without rigor mislabels analytics as Data Science, creating a barrier to getting value from the technology. The result is overly expensive analytics with the AI label slapped on.

## Research for Sustainable Competitive Advantage

Machine Learning's advantage is in its ability to build models that simulate customer experiences, business systems, processes, and even marketplaces. Done well, Data Science **research** happens rapidly based upon iterative data gathering and experimentation. Poor assumptions are discarded early. Experiments are designed to prove the model provides valuable inferences and predictions.

The Data Science team expects to be challenged. They expect review, critiques, and skepticism and are accustomed to it. It is their job to craft experiments and to prove or refute a hypothesis. To be robust, it is also a gated, managed process. Researchers work within budgets, timelines, and deliverables. The research agenda includes artifacts and publications. In contrast, the **digital transformation** agenda is to perpetuate itself.

Consider an industry like FinTech. The reason hedge funds are willing to pay Data Science and Machine Learning Engineers extraordinary salaries is driven by their unique understanding of customer, business, and market performance characteristics. They demonstrate an advantage valued in the billions of dollars.

## Removing Barriers 

Kenny Ning's [blog post](https://kleandata.substack.com/p/data-science-is-different) on his poor experiences as a new hire tell the all-too-common story. His employer's job description read “Data Scientist” with requirements of “Master’s degree or higher; experience in deep learning frameworks a plus.” But that was not the content of the job.

In the end, Kenny was more than glad to get out and find a company where management was actually competent enough to articulate what they were looking for. Ironically, the best tools are largely open source. Much of the talent is already out there, and even upskilling can be relatively inexpensive.

The placement of Data Science within the company organization is critical, as well as enabling the supporting resources. In the last Data Evangelist post I explored [change management and the leadership questions](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/2021-02-05-data-evangelist-part-2/), including:

- Where exactly is our center of excellence for analytics?

- What is the current assessment of analytics maturity?

- Where is the analytics leadership forum, and how are they delivering to the business?

- What best practices opinionated framework guides our selection of the primary tool stack and skills definitions?

- What is our documented data quality strategy? How does the enterprise embrace it?

- Where is our robust feature store of high quality, clean data for modeling to accelerate analytics?

Making tangible change requires frequent communication and widespread awareness of the answers to these questions. And **research**, not **digital transformation**, is the path to AI maturity.

## [Process Mining: Data science in Action by Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining)

Coursera offers this course by Wil van der Aalst as 14 hours of videos, supplementary reading, case studies, quizzes, and an available certificate. A textbook is available.

There are many business contexts where log or event data is available for a process sequence. Consider, for example, dealer repair processes and time to fix. Process mining techniques provide the analyst with tools to model the process visually, explore bottlenecks, and describe conformity. The course provides a cursory link to a handful of machine learning techniques for extending the practice to other domains.

The open source software tools are easy to use. Paid versions are available, though where needed I will be using the excellent R packages and markdown.

Ken Jee's recent short video post "Why I QUIT Data Science" speaks to the role and where it fits into the organization. It's nice that Ken shares his personal journey in a candid way.

## Book recommendations

<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/building-analytics-teams/9781800203167"><img alt="Building Analytics Teams" src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781800203167/cover/smaller" width="250"></a>
by John K. Thompson, with his 30+ years of experience and expertise, illustrates the fundamental concepts of building and managing a high-performance analytics team, including what to do, who to hire, projects to undertake, and what to avoid in the journey of building an analytically sound team. The core processes in creating an effective analytics team and the importance of the business decision-making life cycle are explored to help achieve initial and sustainable success.

"><img alt="The Book of Why" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417Y78D+TeL.jpg
" width="250"></a>

by Judea Pearly and Dana Mackenzie is really three books woven together:

1. An exposition of Pearl’s approach to causal inference.

1. An intellectual history of this and other statistical approaches to causal inference.

1. A series of examples including some interesting discussions of smoking and cancer, going far beyond what you’ll generally see in a popular book or a textbook on statistics or causal inference.

[A Review of The Book of Why by Andrew Gelman here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/01/08/book-pearl-mackenzie/)

<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf"><img alt="Bayesian Data Analysis" src="https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978143984/9781439840955.jpg" width="450"></a>

Now in its third edition, this classic book is widely considered the leading text on Bayesian methods, lauded for its accessible, practical approach to analyzing data and solving research problems. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition continues to take an applied approach to analysis using up-to-date Bayesian methods. The authors—all leaders in the statistics community—introduce basic concepts from a data-analytic perspective before presenting advanced methods. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples drawn from real applications and research emphasize the use of Bayesian inference in practice.

There are many great books out there on machine learning. In a short 239 pages, professor Matloff gives a reasonable introduction to the topic with solid examples.
