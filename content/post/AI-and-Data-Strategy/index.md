DataCamp, the on-line Python, SQL, and R coding school, appears to be pivoting towards marketing their education services to business enterprises, rather than to individual students and universities. In episode 1 of what promises to become a monthly series, [How AI Can Improve Your Data Strategy](https://www.datacamp.com/resources/webinars/how-ai-can-improve-your-data-strategy), Dr. Hugo Bowne-Anderson recognizes that value in this field is created only to the degree that meaningful business problems are solved. 

Employees at many levels need a degree of competence in the emerging fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence to understand when use the tools, when not to use them, and how to talk the talk with data professionals. As of 2020, they are becoming a central part of the decision maker’s toolkit. I've observed that some business executives are particularly prone to demanding AI for everything. There certainly is value in broadening these skill sets beyond analysts. 

In [When Translation Problems Arise Between Data Scientists and Business Stakeholders, Revisit Your Metrics](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/bfeyfx22), Katie Malone aptly remarks that 

> “the metrics which quantify outcomes are generally very different for data scientists and business stakeholders, making it likely that each side struggles to understand and speak in terms that are familiar to the other side.”

A lack of data acumen is a central challenge faced by consumers of analytics. Undergraduate education for all majors in recent decades has certainly not kept up. Everyone at any level, C-level to new employees, should be looking into data the same way that you were expected to start using e-mail 25 years ago. 

Recognizing the need, DataCamp offers a 4-hour interactive video-based series [Data Science for Business](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-science-for-business) that is a good overview. Get ahead of the curve and learn the basics now. In the mean time, many companies are organized with multiple business units reporting to the CEO. In one approach, with a digital AI unit, the company can matrix in AI talent to the different divisions to drive widespread education and cross-functional projects.

# A robust and principled data strategy

> "A real strategy involves a clear set of choices that define what the firm is going to do and what it's not going to do."

As they often do, **Harvard Business Review** in late 2017 published a critique titled 
[Many Strategies Fail Because They're Not Actually Strategies](https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies). Indeed, many of these processes fail because the firm does not have something worth executing.

Consultants come in, do their work, and document the new strategy in a PowerPoint presentation and a weighty report. Town hall meetings are organized, employees are told to change their behavior, balanced scorecards are reformulated, and budgets are set aside to support initiatives that fit the new strategy. And then nothing happens.

![Many Strategies Fail Because They're Not Actually Strategies](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2017/11/nov17-08-135629213-Lobo-Press.jpg)

Strategy is not just a top-down process. A successful strategy execution process is seldom a one-way trickle-down cascade of decisions.

A robust, principled approach will make **change** the default. People’s habits in organizations are notoriously sticky and persistent. Habits certainly don’t change by telling people in a town hall meeting that they should act differently. People are often not even aware that they are doing things in a particular way and that there might be different ways to run the same process.

For a successful strategy implementation process, it is useful to put the default the other way around: Change it unless it is crystal clear that the old way is substantially better. Execution involves change. Embrace it.

# Data Strategy is a function of Business Strategy

> More than 70% of employees have access to data they should not, and 80% of analysts’ time is spent simply discovering and preparing data. 

> on average, less than half of an organization’s structured data is actively used in making decisions—and less than 1% of its unstructured data is analyzed or used at all. 

Having a Chief Digital Officer and a data-management function is a start, but neither can be fully effective in the absence of coherent strategy for organizing, governing, analyzing, and deploying information assets. Though the "plumbing" aspects may not be as sexy as predictive models and dashboards, they are vital to achieving high performance decision making. 

In [What's Your Data Strategy?](https://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy), the authors present frameworks of defensive and offensive strategy elements. For example, tight security and a single source of truth are defensive objectives. Determining an organization’s current and desired positions on the spectrum will force leaders to make trade-offs.

# What is Data?

Data is not a holy grail. The word data translates literally to "things given." It is an active process of collection and action. Nothing illustrates this better than Monica Rogati's [AI Hierarchy of Needs](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007)

![AI Hierarchy of Needs](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png)

If our goal is AI functionality at the top, then at the bottom the organization needs a very robust collection and storage foundation. Transformation, aggregation, and labeling are then built on top. Growth with online experimentation and machine learning becomes possible, but deployment to customers really requires all of the components of the triangle. The most impactful and effective AI strategies will stand on the shoulders of robust data science capabilities.

# What Is AI?

- **Data science** produces **insights**

- **Machine learning** produces **predictions**

- **Artificial intelligence** produces **actions**

Andrew Ng, in his [AI Transformation Playbook](https://landing.ai/ai-transformation-playbook/), speaks to a Virtuous Cycle, where better product yields more users,  more users yields more data, and more data yields a more refined and better product.

# What is Data Science?

> Making discoveries and creating insights from data and communicating these insights and discoveries to non-technical stakeholders

Christopher Berry writes in his blog [Insights Revisited](https://christopherberry.ca/insight-revisited/) that an insight is 

- New information

- Executable

- Causes action

- Profitable

Or, more detailed, an insight is a piece of information that you didn’t know before, which can be feasibly executed, culturally acceptable and of a scale relevant to the firm, and causes a decision to be made that wouldn’t have been made otherwise, and results in profit or a sustainable competitive advantage.

# What do Data Scientists and Analysts actually do?

[What Data Scientists Really Do, According to 35 Data Scientists](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists)

Access to insights is not the same as access to raw data. The needs of the business are served when the collection, transformation, prediction, and deployment of analytics delivers insights. As a result, Data Science practitioners find themselves involved at every step to ensure integrity all of the way through helping decision making.

# What is Machine Learning?

> The science and art of giving computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed

Examples include your e-mail spam filter (supervised) and document clustering (unsupervised). Each is given a general math model space, and the algorithm improves as more data arrives. 

The vast majority of business problems are supervised, leveraging labeled training data. Sources include historical data, an experiment, and even crowd-sourced (like ReCaptcha, Facebook, Amazon Mechanical Turk)
