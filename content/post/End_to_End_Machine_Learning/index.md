Brandon Rohrer of **iRobot** curates a "Teachable" collection of courses/blogs called [End-to-End Machine Learning](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/courses/) which include a number of free introductory sections, including:

[Data Science Concepts](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/data-science-concepts), is a pocket guide to building the things that data scientists build. It opens with a [49 minute video, Data Science for Absolutely Everyone](https://youtu.be/tKa0zDDDaQk) from his days building [these materials in 2016 with Microsoft](https://github.com/brohrer/public-hosting/raw/master/Rohrer_DS_for_everyone.pptx). As amazing as it is, there are only five questions that machine learning can answer:

1. Is this A or B?
1. Is this weird?
1. How much/how many?
1. How is it organized?
1. What should I do next?

[Foundational Skills](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/000-foundational-skills) is an assembly of 9 groups of learning resources, starting with Python, solicited from peers through social media. Brandon gives a nod to the superb [DataSciGuide Learning Directory](www.datasciguide.com/) curated by Renee Teate. He also covers C++, SQL, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Git, and Mental Focus. Make it a point to bookmark some of these resources to come back to later.

[Navigating a Data Science Career](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/navigating-a-data-science-career/) is a lecture series that opens with a July, 2018 [Metis conference talk on Data Scientist archetypes](https://youtu.be/_2g7yqwgAVg) that is still relevant. Brandon continues with interview tips, guidance for building a team, thoughts on tool stacks, best practices for communication, and engaging management.
