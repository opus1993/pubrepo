A digital and analytics career at a heavy equipment OEM offers something most will never experience in the [FAANG](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-faang) ‚Äútech‚Äù companies: the chance to see ideas come to life in real products and services used in farm fields and on customer jobsites all over the world. What we imagine and ultimately make a reality will help customers work more safely, more efficiently and more productively.

Artificial Intelligence will become an increasingly important part of many of the things that are done around here, and not just in autonomy and remote solutions. It will be vital to how we ensure the right part is at the right place when the customer needs it, how technicians service machines, and how we make all of this cost effective.

Data-driven AI has the potential to allow our brands to deliver faster and more personalized customer experiences. Let's be honest: with the new tech, we can optimize dealer and customer experiences in ways that have never been possible in the past. This post explores how a huge organization makes the pivot, through a center of excellence  leadership framework, and

- extreme collaboration
- skills and talent deployment
- and acceleration

Whatever prompted you to read this blog post, I hope that you come away with a handful of useful insights for your own work.

The business opportunities for AI and data analytics go beyond automating the experience of setting up a combine. We must take a full enterprise view of internal AI opportunities related to supply streamlining, dealer operations, inventory management, demand planning, and equipment repair before failure, among many others.

A common challenge is recognizing that we are still in the early stages of AI. It‚Äôs not off-the-shelf shrink wrapped prepackaged software. It requires a high volume of quality data, solid analytics capabilities, and strong business acumen. In most AI use cases, we have to create the data, do the labeling and train the models. Sometimes the solutions are still fairly linear and can be brittle and difficult to flex when the models evolve.

It‚Äôs also important to note that narrow AI still dominates solutions in the marketplace, which for the most part address very specific problems under a defined set of operating conditions. With new technologies and developments the data science community will be able to go after wider opportunities, but for now, it‚Äôs still quite narrowly focused.

One size doesn‚Äôt fit all for every project or team. On the one hand, understanding how to get AI capabilities to the front lines is essential. On the other hand, there are areas that we must be strategically aligned and we need a central core. With a large global dealer network, customer facing operations are fairly decentralized already, so we need to be thinking about AI in that context.

## New title for this section

We need to address a preparedness gap in our talent, from how we hire to how we ensure our employees have the tools they need to build up AI acumen within their functions and markets. We are not na√Øve about the limitations of AI, so it‚Äôs important that we think beyond current constraints and continue to innovate to meet our customers‚Äô needs.

Another challenge will be establishing trust in AI. The increased use of deep learning techniques has caused people to demand explanations of AI models and be certain of the ethics. People don‚Äôt want AI to be a black box. Instead, they really want explainability, that is, to understand what is driving decision recommendations. That‚Äôs a good problem to have, though, because it shows that people see the value in making business decisions driven by data analytics. So the challenge then becomes helping the understand what is driving those recommendations.

a suggestion for future articles would be around analytic maturity within an organization and some basic steps to grow in this area. At least for area that I serve in CNH, I would say we are on the very basic side of analytics and bringing in ideas or inputs on how to grow would be interesting. A big part of our opportunity is to change the questions that we are being asked by the business that we serve. Topics on moving from descriptive analytics to diagnostic to predictive to prescriptive analytics would help folks visualize the opportunity. Maybe you have written these types of articles in the past and I haven‚Äôt seen them. Also would be very interested to see topics around data quality strategies and data access. These are significant issue‚Äôs for us.

Comment on an interesting company this week


A few weeks back I posed several [change management and leadership questions](https://jimgruman.netlify.app/post/2021-02-05-data-evangelist-part-2/). The next two in the series:

- Where is the analytics leadership forum, and how are they delivering to the business?

- What best practices opinionated framework guides our selection of the primary tool stack and skills definitions?



Center of Excellence

Communities of Practice

Affinity groups


Our business leaders recognize the importance of starting with a clear definition of the central question and the business opportunity. The insights and learnings on the AI journey may cause directional adjustments to that central question as you uncover the truth from the data, but keeping it as your beacon is critical. Avoid having the pursuit of business value turn into simply a lab experiment with new technology ‚Äî be ready to adjust course and stay committed. The promise of AI is real, but as you explore the data, the findings may surprise you.

As with others, we do a lot of work with partners and academic institutions externally as well to help democratize AI and take others along on the data literacy journey. That doesn‚Äôt mean making everybody a data scientist, but it calls for establishing data literacy throughout McDonald‚Äôs. In addition, we want to expose the community to what we‚Äôre doing and how we‚Äôre doing it.

Machine learning is a broad field, encompassing pieces of computer science, statistics, and mathematics. There are hundreds of concepts to learn. Chris Albon's flashcards are designed to help memorize key concepts in machine learning rapidly and enjoyably.
