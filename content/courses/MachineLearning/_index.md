**Machine learning** (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.

Before embarking on a study of Machine learning, invest some time in understanding the drivers for **Data Science** and Data-Analytic thinking in our economy, in business, and in academia. Consider the ethical dimensions of data collection and building new decision tools. From analyzing drug trials to helping sports teams pick new draftees, data scientists utilize data to tackle many of the big questions today. But despite demand, high competition and big expectations make data science a challenging field for the unprepared to break into and navigate. Alongside their technical skills, the successful data scientist needs to be a master of understanding data projects, adapting to company needs, and managing stakeholders. 

[Data Science for Business, What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028918.do?cmp=af-strata-books-video-product-cj_auwidget313_0636920028918_7213599) presents a set of fundamental principles for extracting useful knowledge from data.  These principles are the basis of many algorithms for data mining and underlie methods for approaching business problems data-analytically.

[Everybody Lies, Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz](http://everybodyliesbook.com/) offers ground level revelations into ourselves, our lives, and the profound impacts that Machine Learning tools have.

Machine learning is built on a statistics foundation. There are excellent materials available from Coursera and even Khan Academy if you need a review. I keep this textbook handy: [![Statistics for Business and Economics by Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, and Cochran](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518wsxobmEL._SX342_QL70_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Business-Economics-Revised-Anderson-ebook/dp/B06X9B44C9)

Obviously, a strong background in the R Language and Data Visualization is critical in accomplishing tasks and communicating results. Brush up on Data Management, and especially SQL.

Finally, to succeed applying machine learning to solve data science problems, [Build a Career in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science) teaches you what school leaves out, from how to land your first job, to the lifecycle of a data science project, and even how to become a manager.
