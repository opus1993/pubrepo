## Data Exploration

This time we will load all of the packages in <span style="color:blue">tidyverse</span>.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
usedcars <-
  read_csv('./usedcars.csv')
```

We can measure the spread of the features independently. For example, for the 'price' feature, we can get mean, min, max and range.

```{r }
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% mean()
```
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% min()
```
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% max()
```
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% range()
```

We can also get the difference of the range,...
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% range() %>% diff()
```

...and the inter-quartile range (Q3-Q1) using the <span style="color:red">IQR()</span> function. 
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% IQR()
```

We can also use the <span style="color:red">quantile()</span> function to calculate the five-number summary, ...
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% quantile()
```

... and the 1st and 99th percentiles for example.
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% quantile(probs = c(0.01, 0.99))
```

The <span style="color:red">var()</span> and <span style="color:red">sd()</span> functions give us the variance and standard deviation. 
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% var()
usedcars %>% pull(price) %>% sd()
```

Remember that we can also get summary statistics on discrete features. 
```{r}
summary(usedcars$price)
```

Notice that 'model', 'color' and 'transmission' are treated as string values. To get better summaries, we need to convert them to factors. Let's also convert 'year' to a factor.
```{r}
usedcars <- mutate(usedcars, year = as.factor(year))
usedcars <- mutate(usedcars, model = as.factor(model))
usedcars <- mutate(usedcars, color = as.factor(color))
usedcars <- mutate(usedcars, transmission = as.factor(transmission))
```

Notice the differences in the presentation of the factors in the summary
```{r}
summary(usedcars)
```

To see the full data distribution for a feature, we use the <span style="color:red">table()</span> function.
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(year) %>% table()
usedcars %>% pull(color) %>% table()
```

We can also compute the distribution proportions (rounded to 2 decimal places).
```{r}
usedcars %>% pull(model) %>% table()
usedcars %>% pull(model) %>% table() %>% prop.table() %>% round(digits=4) * 100
```

Let's do some visual exploration against our data.

Create a scatterplot of price vs. mileage.
```{r}
usedcars %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mileage, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Price vs. Mileage", 
       x = "Used Car Odometer (mi.)", 
       y = "Used Car Price ($)",
       caption = "Plot: Jim Gruman. Data: usedcars")+theme_minimal()
```
What can we infer from the scatterplot?
 
What if we tried to group our plot by transmission? Do we learn anything new?
```{r}
usedcars %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mileage, y = price, color = transmission)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Price vs. Mileage", 
       x = "Used Car Odometer (mi.)", 
       y = "Used Car Price ($)",
       caption = "Plot: Jim Gruman. Data: usedcars")+theme_minimal()+
       theme(legend.position = "top")
```

What about grouping by model?
```{r}
usedcars %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mileage, y = price, color = model)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Price vs. Mileage", 
       x = "Used Car Odometer (mi.)", 
       y = "Used Car Price ($)",
       caption = "Plot: Jim Gruman. Data: usedcars")+theme_minimal()+
       theme(legend.position = "top")
```

And when you group by year, what do we see?
```{r}
usedcars %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mileage, y = price, color = year)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Price vs. Mileage", x = "Used Car Odometer (mi.)", y = "Used Car Price ($)",
       caption = "Plot: Jim Gruman. Data: usedcars")+theme_minimal()+
       theme(legend.position = "left")
```

Using a box plot to show price by year reveals the expected.
```{r}
usedcars %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price, fill = year)) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Used Car Prices by Year", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Price ($)",
       caption = "Plot: Jim Gruman. Data: usedcars")+
       theme_minimal()+
       theme(legend.position = "")
```

What does the boxplot of price by model type tell us?
```{r}
usedcars %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = model, y = price, fill = model)) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Used Car Prices by Model", 
       x = "Model", 
       y = "Price ($)",
       caption = "Plot: Jim Gruman. Data: usedcars")+
       theme_minimal()+
       theme(legend.position = "")
```
