The mothership for all things R is the [R project](https://www.r-project.org/) site. From there you can download R for your platform, add-on packages, documentation, and source code as well as many other resources. There are many, many books about learning and using R. The R project site contains an extensive bibliography of books related to R.

The [R Cookbook 2nd Edition](https://rc2e.com/index.html#other-resources) by J.D. Long and Paul Teetor is a wonderful deskside reference. Many of their examples, or recipes, are included in this web resource. Of course, there are likely several reasonable solutions to each problem. This is a cookbook, not a bible. Example code and data are posted at the [R Cookbook GitHub](https://github.com/CerebralMastication/R-Cookbook)

[R for Data Science](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (O’Reilly), is a solid introduction to the tidyverse, especially for using them in data analysis and statistics. It is also available online at [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

The [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd ed., by Winston Chang](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920063704.do) is indispensible for creating graphics. The book *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham (Springer)* is the definitive reference for the graphics package ggplot2.

Anyone doing serious graphics work in R will want *R Graphics by Paul Murrell (Chapman & Hall/CRC)*.

Use of git and GitHub are important for team collaboration. Find Jenny Bryan’s web book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/).

[R in a Nutshell, by Joseph Adler (O’Reilly)](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596801717), is another quick tutorial and reference you’ll keep by your side. Consider [Hands On Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund (O’Reilly) for an introduction, or The Art of R Programming by Normal Matloff (No Starch Press)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-programming-with/9781449359089/). Hadley Wickham’s *Advanced R Programming* is available either as a printed book or free online and is a great deeper dive into advanced R topics. [Efficient R Programming, by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace (O’Reilly)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920047995.do), is another good guide to learning the deeper concepts about R programming.
